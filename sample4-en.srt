1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I didn't know what to say to Turk next and then it happened.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Sir, the door was open. I know. I just love doing that.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 What now, Grandpa?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 You are going to shut your damn yapper and listen to a change because I got you pegged, sweetheart.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 You want to take the easy way out with this surgery because you're scared.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And you're scared because if you try and fail there's only you to blame.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Well, Missy, let me break the door.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,840
 down for you, Bobbo style. Life is scary. Get used to it.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,480
 And then it seemed like Dr. Kelso wasn't only talking to her.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,480
 There are no magical fixes. It's all up to you. So get up off your keister, get out of

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,040
 here and go start doing the work. What if it's too hard?

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,640
 Yeah, what if it's too hard? Dirkledon, I have no idea why you're chiming

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,960
 in, but I'll say this to both of you. Nothing in this world that's worth having.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hamming comes easy.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I gotta go.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Okay, here it goes.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Oh, this is so weird.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I don't really know what to say.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Sorry I haven't visited much, I've been kinda busy.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 That's not true. Why am I lying to a slut with granite?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I just know I really could have used that.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I used you around this week.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I miss you.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Can you tell her I miss her too?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 You know what? Never mind.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Because she wouldn't believe it.
