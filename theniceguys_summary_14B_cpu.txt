A group of friends spends a leisure day at the city pool, but their attention is drawn to a mysterious private investigator named Holland March. As they discuss their belongings (plain, bright, and "gay" towels), the characters' lives intertwine with a murder investigation, a corrupt justice system, and a conspiracy involving a porn star's death. Amidst the chaos, March tries to unravel the truth and protect the innocent, including a young woman named Amelia, whose life is in danger due to a film she made exposing her mother's involvement in a sinister plot. With hidden agendas and unexpected alliances, the characters navigate a web of deceit and corruption during a high-profile auto show in 1978 Los Angeles.
