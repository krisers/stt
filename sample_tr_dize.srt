1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Don't forget, I went out for dinner.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What was the street you were going to?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Food Street.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good. Which soup shop did you go to?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's a lot.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good, you puppy.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You had two plates of soup for the soup shop.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to get it.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My turn is coming.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Get up! Get up!

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why did you do it?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Don't mess with me.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Why did you kill my son?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There is no scandal yet.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What is it here?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mr. Suat, please.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You are a murderer.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You are a murderer.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Please don't make any trouble.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, sir, please.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
- I know.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Mr. Sergeant, as you have examined in the file,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We demand that the person who has the highest suspicion of committing the crime be sentenced to prison.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Mr. Sergeant, what does it mean to be sentenced to prison?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're talking about a person who has never committed any crime before.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's not talk in front of each other without permission.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please, excuse me.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Mr. Sergeant,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the late Muhtar is not staying in Istanbul.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He said he was here to find a job for a week,

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but no job application has been identified.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Also, he is likely to return to his country.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Since our country is within the borders of Gaziantep,

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How can he go there?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'd like to ask you, with your permission.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He lied.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He said that the vehicle was stolen and he didn't leave the hotel.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
However, he said that he had already made a proper move on the PTS record

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And that he left the hotel before the time was enough for him to return to the hotel.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He was in pain.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He didn't realize that he was being stolen and that he had never looked at the car.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then he went to the soup shop and drank two plates of drink.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He was in pain.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mr. Judge, I just sent a copy of your pencil.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's fixed with the images he's been looking for.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'd like to make a statement with your permission.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We don't know anything, Mr. Judge.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because Mr. Prosecutor is persistently hiding information from us

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And putting a delay to the file and the file.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can be in charge of this, Ms. Lawyer.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The DEAL armed forces have just taken over and I brought it.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is there anything wrong, Mr. Judge?

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, Mr. Prosecutor. I'm not going to tell you.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The method is appropriate.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Judge, look, Maktul and Shuperin have no common link.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My client didn't even come to Istanbul a week ago.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They don't follow any media, they haven't mailed each other,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They don't even have any friends.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I wish you had shared this information with us, Ms. Lawyer.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You should have asked for an examination.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a long story now.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Anyway, the experience may be lacking.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Judge, there is no reason for my client to be arrested.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're asking for the files to be examined.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Also, if Maktul and Shuperin came to the side, please examine the HTS records.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Of course, I will examine them with permission.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Of course, I will examine them with your permission.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then I will ask you, Mr. Prosecutor,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why did Mr. Peer kill a young man he didn't know?

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
As you just saw, my client is not drinking two plates of soup

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and is looking for Umraniye.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
While he is trying to lie and to deceive justice,

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
which is what this lie is trying to scare me,

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sure that his lawyer will help him escape.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's up to you, Mr. Judge.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What was that, Mr. Prosecutor?

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a letter from the lawyer.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And a letter from the court.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Where was that letter when they said they were going to escape together?

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You may leave.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, I think the lawyer is strong enough

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to not be able to slander the prosecutor.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
May I learn?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I knew there was no camera in that beautiful room.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Even your soup maker was there.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your client was the first to come to Istanbul.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have the details well-designed,

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But don't forget that the real lie always comes true.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Your assumptions will only come true if you prove them.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You may leave.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You know that the next trial will be released, right?

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, he doesn't even know the deceased person.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then why was he there?

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Maybe he didn't want anyone to know.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He did something shameful.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Maybe it was a crime.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Maybe he was trying to cover up a murder.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What do you think, Mr. Prosecutor?

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Secrets are not always shameful, Mr. Prosecutor.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sometimes they are to protect the one you love.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Or you can lie and hide a secret

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So that someone else's lover doesn't hurt him.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't think you've ever done that in your life.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I haven't been.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Why?

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Aren't you human?

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't you ever make mistakes?

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
These are big words.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're talking too much.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Making mistakes is not destiny.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's an election, Mr. Prosecutor.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If I'm in the wrong election,

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can complain to me about anything you want.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Even the armed forces.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
God willing.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I hope I'll see those days.
