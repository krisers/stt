 So, do you recognize any of these men?
 I was hiding in the bathroom stall,
 so I didn't see his face, but I heard him.
 He was singing along to the music at the bar.
 Do you remember what he was singing?
 I think it was that song, I Want It That Way.
 Backstreet Boys. I'm familiar. Okay.
 Number one, could you please sing the opening
 to I Want It That Way?
 Really?
 Okay.
 You are
 my fire
 Number two, keep it going.
 I want the one desire
 Number three, believe when I say
 Number four, I want it that way
 Tell me why
 Ain't nothing but a heartache
 Tell me why
 Ain't nothing but a mistake
 Now number five, I never want to hear you say
 Woo!
 I want it that way
 Ah, chills. Literal chills.
 It was number five. Number five killed my brother.
 Oh, my God. I forgot about that part.
