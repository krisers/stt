1
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:10,525
Oh...

2
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,567
Oh...

3
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,005
Fran! / Niles!

4
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,740
Was it as good for you
 as it was for me?

5
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:25,824
Actually, Niles, 
I was faking it.

6
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,524
Hi, Fran. 
/ Oh, hi, sweetie.

7
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:33,035
Say, some of the kids are going
 to the 	Hamptons for the weekend.

8
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,056
Oh, great.  Will there be boys there?

9
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:40,477
Maybe a few. 
/ Fun.  Parents?

10
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:43,893
Ah, who cares? 
 They'll just get in the way anyway.

11
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:47,763
Go, have a blast. 
 We don't even have to tell your father.

12
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,586
Really? 
/ Oh, sure.

13
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,841
And when I'm fired,
 and you're in the convent,

14
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:55,404
we'll write each other letters 
	and laugh about this.

15
00:00:56,736 --> 00:01:00,498
But, Maxwell, how can you say
 no to working with Philipe?

16
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:04,464
He's an avant garde genius. 
/ Guilty as charged.

17
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,930
And I've put a new twist
 on the tragedy.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,505
We follow Romeo and Juliet to heaven
 and have a happy ending.

19
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,558
You're rewriting one of 
the greatest love stories of all time?

20
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,715
We're adding a few scenes. 
 But we're taking out others.

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:23,254
Which ones?
 / The ones that don't work.

22
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:27,392
Well, I'm sorry Philipe, but we British 
have a thing about mutilating Shakespeare.

23
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:30,747
The Queen comes and hits
 you with her purse.

24
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:32,991
But I bet you have
 a big name to star.

25
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,501
I'm looking for an unknown, 
a fresh face with a unique voice.

26
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,253
It's in the medicine chest!

27
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:47,138
Between the corn pads 
and the Monistat Seven!

28
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,710
I've found my Juliet!

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,721
What?

30
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:51,056
Can you imagine anything more ridiculous
 than me doing Shakespeare?

31
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:54,469
Well, yes.  
People paying to see it.

32
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,976
Ha-ha.  I'll have you know 
that in high	school,

33
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,935
I played the Reverend Mother 
in the Sounds of Music.

34
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,856
I put a low scooped neck
 into my nun's habit,

35
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:09,066
and those hills were alive.

36
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:14,703
We did the Sound of Music.  
I played the Baroness.

37
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,588
It was an all boys school.

38
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:22,237
Thank God I didn't play the guitar. 
I would have been Maria.

39
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,946
Fran, you can't be in the play. 
/ Yeah, who would do our laundry?

40
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:27,185
Clean our room? 
 Wait on us hand and foot.

41
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:31,204
Well, the same person 
that always does. Niles.

42
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:34,432
Besides, if I do it, it would only
 be for a couple of weeks.

43
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:37,863
Actually, I could rehearse 
while the kids are at school.

44
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:41,197
I think not. 
/ Why think you not?

45
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:44,240
I could use a life outside of
 this house. / Me, too.

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,048
Which is why you should let me go
 to the Hamptons. / Nice try.

47
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:52,243
Forget it.  Look, Miss Fine, 
taking care of the children is a fulltime job.

48
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:56,144
Oh, and I suppose it was
 my idea to have three?

49
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:59,023
What you do in your spare time
 is entirely your own affair.

50
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:02,653
I'm simply trying to protect you from having
 an embarrassing theatrical experience.

51
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:05,943
We know what that's like,
 don't we, sir?

52
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:10,649
You know, if some people aren't 
a little more supportive,

53
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:14,354
I might omit them from 
my Oscar speech.

54
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,647
Tony, Miss Fine.  You win a Tony, 
not an Oscar.

55
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,365
Actually for an off-Broadway performance,
 Miss Fine would win the Obie.

56
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,088
She's not going to win anything.

57
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:25,064
Well, thank you for
 that vote of confidence.

58
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:29,353
That's it.  I'm playing Juliet, 
and nothing is going to stop me.

59
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:33,628
And I'm going to the Hamptons... 
/ Now sit down, Margaret.

60
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:35,614
Okay.

61
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:45,214
Okay, Niles, will you play Romeo?

62
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:48,086
Isn't he too old?

63
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:54,727
Well, actually, Juliet's supposed to be
 my age, so it's not like Fran's...

64
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:58,951
not perfect for the role.

65
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:01,908
I warn you, my acting prowess 
may blow you off the stage.

66
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:05,157
They're still talking 
about my baroness.

67
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:09,074
I can't stop thinking about it 
and I didn't even see it.

68
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,239
And I spent my summers 
in Stratford-Upon-Avon.

69
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:16,335
I spent my summers selling Avon.

70
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:21,241
Oh, she doth teach
 the torches to burn bright.

71
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:24,745
It seems she hangs upon 
the cheek of night. / Niles...Niles...

72
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:27,157
Yes?  What?
 / Don't I come in here somewhere?

73
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:29,994
And on and on.  Beauty to rich
 for youth but a...

74
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,662
All right, back off, Baroness.
  And by the way,

75
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:36,021
you're supposed to dust
 the scenery, not chew it.

76
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:38,164
Well, pity.  Show me 
how it's done, Mistress Fine.

77
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:42,794
Well, I will if you'll just shuty upth.

78
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:50,213
All for a falconer's voice to lure
 this tasseled gentile back again.

79
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:56,480
It's gentle, not gentile.

80
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:01,635
How the hell should I know? 
Did I look down his tights?

81
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,793
I still can't understand why Philipe
 would hire Miss Fine to play Juliet?

82
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:12,712
Oh, please.  Only an idiot 
would hire her to do anything...

83
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,458
in the theater.

84
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:25,458
Oh, oh, Mister Sheffield, um, 
if you've got a minute, I could use your help.

85
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,594
That's the understatement 
of the century.

86
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,685
Meanwhile, if we put an apple
 in his mouth, we can have a luau.

87
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:38,457
Let me see.  
Oh, I just love this play.

88
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:42,815
More torches here.  Ah, Sara, 
by my fay, it waxes late.

89
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:44,794
See?  That's exactly what
 I'm talking about.

90
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:48,881
Who the hell is Fay and why is 
she waxing during a party?

91
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,643
Good luck.

92
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:57,537
Shall I play Romeo to your Juliet?
 / Four, three, two...  What took you so long?

93
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,130
All right, so now we're
 star crossed lovers.

94
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:07,213
Let's get some physical realism into this, 
shall we? / Oh, Mister Sheffield.

95
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:10,968
No, no, I mean, I'm gonna put 
you on your balcony. / Okay.

96
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:15,327
All right.  Now Juliet is 
dreaming of her Romeo. / Right.

97
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:20,397
And she says... 
/ Why me?

98
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,292
Oh, speak again, 
bright angel.

99
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,697
Oh, Romeo, Romeo...

100
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,537
Yes, now maybe we could have a little
 more lilting. Just a bit more melodic.

101
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,332
Oh, sure, sure, sure.  Melodic.

102
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:36,136
Oh, Romeo? Romeo?

103
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:40,289
Yeah, just a little too melodic,
 I think. Let me show you.

104
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,419
Oh, okay.  Sure. 
 He's gonna show us.

105
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:49,216
All right.  Oh, Romeo, Romeo, 
where for art thou, Romeo?

106
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:53,027
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

107
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:57,938
Wow.  You British guys 
really know how to play women.

108
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,992
We, uh, we did 
this play in college.

109
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:05,524
Oh, you must have been 
the perfect Romeo.

110
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:08,024
No.  I was Friar Lawrence, actually.

111
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:12,381
That's the problem going to school
 with Jeremy Irons. All right,

112
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,193
let's go on.

113
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:20,353
Okay.  Romeo, doth thy name and...

114
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:23,725
take all of me.

115
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,740
I take thee at thy word.  Call me 
but love and I'll be new baptized.

116
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,540
You know, if I were directing this,
 I'd go in a whole different direction.

117
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,320
Night, goodnight. 
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

118
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,070
Sleep dwell in thine eyes,
 peace in thy breast.

119
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,750
Oh, would I were sleep in peace
 so sweet to rest...

120
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,774
You know, because this lovey-dovey stuff 
has just been done to death.

121
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,665
You know...

122
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:08,604
Much better.

123
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:13,095
Yeah, I, I think I'm starting
 to get the hang of it now...

124
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:21,350
Of course I'm gonna need 
a lot of coaching.

125
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,518
Ah-ha!  Ah-ha, ha!

126
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:41,957
I'm Dracula, I'm gonna suck out
 all your blood and bury you alive!

127
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,999
You don't scare me. / All right, 
fine.  I'm the C.C. monster,

128
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:50,348
and I'm gonna marry Dad and 
send you away to boarding school!

129
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:57,661
Children, children, children,

130
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,367
be quiet!

131
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:02,940
Jeez, Dad, you don't have
 to scream about it.

132
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,325
Look, I already sent you 
to bed five times.

133
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,753
What are you doing still up? 
/ Well I'm not tired.

134
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:11,966
Well maybe that has something to do with
 the pound of chocolate I told you not to eat.

135
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:16,134
You know, I think it was the gallon
 of cola you told me not to drink.

136
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:19,398
And what's your excuse?
 / Well, he took me out.

137
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:22,735
Obviously, you got out.

138
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,944
Now go on, off to bed, both of you.

139
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,767
Just give me one good reason why 
I can't go to the Hamptons.

140
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,832
I won't let you.

141
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,451
Look, Margaret, you're much too young
 to go away for the weekend.

142
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:39,379
By the time Juliet was my age, 
she had already gotten married, 
had sex, and died.

143
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:44,008
Well now you see what happens
 when you don't listen to your father.

144
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:50,266
Niles, I'm thinking of changing 
the childrens' bedtime. / Oh, to when, sir?

145
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:53,000
Right after school.

146
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,869
I can't believe Miss Fine
 isn't back yet.

147
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:58,070
I can't believe what's 
happened to my roast.

148
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,270
It's starting to bear a strange 
resemblance to Hume Cronan.

149
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,563
I mean, how much rehearsal 
can one person need?

150
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,702
Oh, right.  But still.

151
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:14,766
Oh, hi, guys.  For sooth, am I pooped.

152
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:19,241
Dinner is coming right up. 
/ Oh, Niles, I already ate.

153
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,297
You couldn't have called?

154
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:24,789
Never mind.  Ruined anyway.

155
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:30,407
Boy, is he moody.
 / Well, you are rather late.

156
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:33,477
What are you two?  
On the same cycle?

157
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:38,144
What's the problem? 
 Oh, you couldn't handle the kids?

158
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:39,928
Oh, don't make me laugh.

159
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:42,800
What do you think the minute you leave
 the entire house falls apart?

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,492
Oh, oh...
 / No, don't go in there.

161
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,882
Why not? / Well, use the back stairs.
  They're closer.

162
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:53,188
No, they're not. / Yes, they are.
 / Are not. / Are so.  I measured.

163
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:56,161
Okay.  Too slow... / Oh...

164
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:02,282
Oh my God!

165
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:10,951
Oh, this place looks worse than when my mother 
ransacked my bedroom looking for my diary.

166
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:15,569
Well, I was looking for my glasses. 
/ What'd you have a reading emergency?

167
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,265
So, what were you doing all evening? 
/ I was at rehearsal.

168
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,253
Well I called. Rehearsal
 was over at eight.

169
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:24,949
Well, we went out after.
 / Ahh...  Who's "we"?

170
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:29,403
Oh, you know, Romeo, Macuseo, Tebilt.

171
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:32,114
The gang.

172
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,425
Oh, I'm sorry. 
 It was an accident.

173
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,160
So was that.

174
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,004
Boy, you leave the house for a couple hours, 
you come back and it's a pig sty.

175
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:46,153
Yeah, well, maybe if you had been here, 
your children wouldn't have been running amuck!

176
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:49,142
Oh, so when they're sweet, adorable 
angels, they're your children.

177
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:53,311
And when they're amuck, they're mine.
 / Well, you are the nanny!

178
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,580
And that's all you want me to be!

179
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,476
Oh, good god, now I'm getting 
one of my headaches.

180
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,697
You know what I think? 
 You are jealous

181
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,909
because Philipe discovered something 
that was right under your nose.

182
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:11,646
And what would that be exactly? 
/ My star quality.

183
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,888
That's rather like
 discovering the atomic bomb.

184
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:19,502
Sounds good in theory, 
but millions will suffer.

185
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:23,114
Well that's it.  
I'm going home to my mother.

186
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:27,587
No, don't bother! 
 I'm sleeping on the couch!

187
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,631
What... If we're splitting up, 
I get Niles!

188
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:36,799
You couldn't afford him!
 / Not on what you pay me!

189
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:43,053
It's always the butler who suffers.

190
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,105
Oh...

191
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:59,059
I'm working.

192
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,071
Pretend I'm not here.
 That's how I get through the day.

193
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,241
Oh, hello, Niles. 
/ Hm-hmm.

194
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:13,218
Would you mind telling Mister Sheffield
 that I'm going to rehearsal.

195
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:18,797
Unless, of course, he'd like me 
to sit by his feet and peel him a grape.

196
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:22,792
Well, that's my job. 
But you can wave the fan.

197
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:28,861
Well, you can tell the nanny that I wouldn't
 dream of standing in the way of her aspirations,

198
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,572
no matter how ludicrous they might be.

199
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:35,533
Well, tell Mister Sheffield 
that I am a grown woman,

200
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,157
and can find fulfillment
 anyway I choose.

201
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:43,660
And that he is a doodyhead.

202
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:50,446
To synopsis, sir, you are a doodyhead.

203
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:54,849
So that's the one you choose to repeat. 
/ Translator's prerogative.

204
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:58,586
I don't think I've ever met a more
 infuriating, irritating woman.

205
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:01,252
Hello, hello.

206
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,503
Think hard, sir.

207
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:09,132
I just heard the most
 delicious news.

208
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:13,156
Well, why don't you run make a friend
 and tell them all about it.

209
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:17,904
Philipe needs a tax write-off,
 so he wants the show to flop.

210
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:22,578
That's why he cast Nanny Fine, 
to guarantee a total disaster.

211
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:28,385
I knew it!  Ha! 
 I knew she had no talent.

212
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,677
People will be walking out 
in the middle of her performance.

213
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:34,916
Just like one of your dates.

214
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:39,608
Well, we, we can't tell her.
  She'll be crushed.

215
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:41,864
I know.

216
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:46,750
On the other hand, if, if I don't tell her, 
then she'll be publicly humiliated opening night.

217
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,657
I know.  It's a win-win situation.

218
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,988
Maggie, if you wanna go to the Hamptons,

219
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:03,279
you're gonna have to ask your father
 when he's watching Masterpiece Theater.

220
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,786
Yes. Just when his chin drops 
down to his chest,

221
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:10,351
but before he starts snoring.

222
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,575
Yeah, sure.
 That's how I got my raise.

223
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,385
We're doing the dance scene! 
Places, everybody!

224
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:22,774
Oh, Maggie, I gotta go.  I gotta go
 plunge a knife into my heart.

225
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:26,629
Oh boy, I'm sounding more like
 my mother every day.

226
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:31,204
Oh, uh, Philipe, I gotta ask you a question.
 I don't know what my motivation is here.

227
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:34,139
Why does Juliet kill herself?

228
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,146
Because without her Romeo 
she has no reason to live.

229
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:42,612
Oh.  Could tell this play was 
written by a man.

230
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,717
I don't know how she got this part. 
/ Well, she must be sleeping with him.

231
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:49,357
I slept with him.
  I got two lines.

232
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:52,535
I got Romeo.

233
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:57,668
Okay.  Romeo?

234
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,184
Drink your poison...

235
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:11,177
Here's to my love.

236
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:17,034
Thy drugs act quick, 
thus with a kiss...

237
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,503
I die. 
/ Now Juliet awakens.

238
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,699
Oy, what a night!

239
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:38,194
Oh, Romeo, I see poison.

240
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:45,560
I see poison has been
 your timeless end.

241
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,709
Oh, churl...

242
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:58,151
Oh happy dagger, this is thy sheath.

243
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:07,099
There rust and let me die.

244
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:13,761
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

245
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:18,245
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, oh...

246
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:22,147
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

247
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:28,729
Oh, oh, oh...

248
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:37,191
She's perfect. This play will 
die faster than she does.

249
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:40,346
Oh, oy...

250
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:46,500
And now, Romeo and 
Juliet ascend to heaven.

251
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:55,729
Oh, my lord Romeo, 
I follow thee to heaven.

252
00:18:55,903 --> 00:19:01,664
Whoa...  Whoa...

253
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,166
Oy, hey, you guys.  
Heaven art that-a-way.

254
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:11,061
Oh, oh...

255
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:20,202
Wow, hey... Oh, oh, hey, oh, whoa...

256
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:27,089
Oh boy, don't worry.  I'm okay.

257
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:32,460
Oh, but it looks like Romeo's got
 quite a wedgie going on up there.

258
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,425
Oy...

259
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,555
Hi...

260
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:44,190
Hi...  Gee, you know,
 that harness really chafes.

261
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,730
Boy, that Mary Martin must have
 had a hide like a rhino.

262
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,286
Hey, I know you.

263
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:58,014
Well, I have done six Broadway
 shows and several national tours.

264
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:01,142
No, no, it was a commercial.

265
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:05,716
You're the Less Than Fresh girl.

266
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,970
Oh, Mister Sheffield.

267
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:14,604
No, please... 
 People, people, please!

268
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:17,506
Come on, back off! Get away!

269
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:20,836
Let the man breathe. 
 Give him some air.  Jeez...

270
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,878
God, she's sleeping with everybody.

271
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:28,968
Watch.  Next year 
she'll have her own sitcom.

272
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:35,049
Miss Fine, I, I owe you an apology.

273
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:39,381
You owe me an apology?  Oh, yeah, right.

274
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:43,435
I was selfish and thoughtless 
and I'm extremely sorry.

275
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:46,992
Oh, thank you, Mister Sheffield.

276
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:50,337
I'm sorry I called you a doodyhead.

277
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,289
Apology accepted.

278
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:57,584
You know, we shouldn't fight anymore.
 It's so hard on Niles. / Yeah, I know.

279
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:02,426
Listen, I, uh, I need to talk to you 
about this play. Maybe you better sit down.

280
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:05,287
Oh, okay.  I think I know what 
you're gonna say though.

281
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,211
No, I doubt that.
 / Yes, I do.

282
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:12,943
You're gonna say that you and the kids really
 need me at home, and the mansion is a mess.

283
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:18,318
And I don't belong in this play and
 well, you'd be absolutely right.

284
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:22,251
I would? / Yeah.  Isn't that 
what you were gonna say?

285
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:27,661
Oh, yes.  Yes.  That was exactly 
what... Yes. You read my mind.

286
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,054
Oh, clairvoyance runs in my family.

287
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:34,654
I got an Aunt Paula that
 predicted Hurricane Andrew.

288
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:40,373
For the first time in history, 
there wasn't a single Jew on Miami Beach.

289
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:44,294
Come on. I'm gonna take you home.

290
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:47,527
I just hope that Philip 
isn't too disappointed.

291
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:50,984
I mean, he really was counting on me.

292
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:55,024
Well, Miss Fine, a talent like yours 
doesn't come along every day.

293
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:58,739
True.  But you know, between you,
 me and the pillars,

294
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:03,333
that Philipe is not 
the greatest director in the world.

295
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,597
And if I'm gonna make 
my big Broadway debut,

296
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:11,888
I should do it right, in one 
of your plays. / Right.  Um...

297
