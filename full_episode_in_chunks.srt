1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
 Music

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,160
 Choo Choo 주세요

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,160
 Ah

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
 Hmm?

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hmm.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 6 a.m.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at 3 a.m.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hee hee hee.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Huh?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Where's Marge?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Maggie?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Has anyone seen anyone?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Oh, of course.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 They must all be taking a family bath.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Without me.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Brrr.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Fine.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Google Maps.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Brrr.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Ah!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 What's going on?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Why are you attacking me?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Oh, my face.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 My dog hates me and I can't remember what happened last night.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Was I here?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Was you ever.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 You came in saying you really needed to forget something,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 The Forget-Me Shot.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Gunk from a dog's eye, absolute pickle.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Mmm, pickle.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 The Red Stripe from Aqua Fresh,

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 and the funniest ingredient, the venom of the Louisiana Lobotomoth.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And presto, the Forget-Me Shot.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Ha, geez, I don't look like Dad.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Whoa.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Gimme one.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,280
 One of those forgive me drinks.

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,140
 I made a mistake, I gotta wipe out.

41
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,780
 I was trying to do a Don Rickles about Arabs,

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,660
 but it turned into a Mel Gibson about Mexicans.

43
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,940
 There he is.

44
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,120
 There he is.

45
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
 Oh my God.

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,400
 Why would I wanna wipe out my memory?

47
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,360
 What horrible thing did I do?

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,440
 You don't remember, huh?

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,220
 There was a domestic disturbance

50
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,560
 at your address yesterday.

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,880
 What's going on here, Simpson?

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,720
 Am I gonna need the zip strips?

53
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,600
 Everything's fine.

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,640
 Cupcakes and sprinkles.

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
 I said.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,520
 And how did you get that? What gives Simpson given your wife an Irish kiss?

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,040
 March had a black eye. I could never do something like that

58
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,000
 Could I why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint?

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,280
 Not that I am authorized to release that in Flanders fine. It was Flanders. What did I do?

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,440
 Yeah, I can't say for sure but as a Christian I assume the worst

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
 What happened in this room?

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Stop Homer, please!

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 My eye!

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
 No, it can't be! I would never hurt Mark!

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,680
 Thank goodness you come to visit me, son.

66
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,800
 I can't take one more minute of this high school glee club pretending they don't hate being here.

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 Oh, what a lie!

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,000
 You'll eat our cookies, but you won't look at us!

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Dad, I can't remember...

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,160
 what I did last night. Do you have any idea? You come to me for help remembering?

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,380
 I know someone who can help you. A doctor who helps people dig up old memories.

72
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,380
 Really? That's great, Dad. Mr. Simpson, I have built a device that will enable you to

73
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,860
 explore your memories. These wonderful wrinkle bags are reliving their

74
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,660
 cherished memories of yesteryear. Oh, my first Christmas. Such great

75
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,860
 cher...

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Chinese food.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 This is great.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,360
 Now you feel a slight pinch followed by an extremely painful pinch signaling that the

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,400
 spike will begin boring into your skull three seconds later.

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
 Boring.

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 Yes, that's right, boring.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,560
 Oh, I learned it in a pleasant memory.

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,760
 Look at happy me and playful them.

84
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 And we're off.

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,760
 Now remember, steer into the sculptures.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I missed those bygone days of earlier this week.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But I'm needed in a darker place.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Those squeaks sound like couch springs grooving to the beat of love.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Homer! I wasn't expecting you!

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I gotta find out who that guy is, but I need to know who he is.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I need help. Someone like Bart. Only smart.

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,000
 Lisa!

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
 I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,500
 Might as well. You're getting this memory mixed up with a commercial you saw.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,500
 With new Synergy Wireless, nighttime minutes start at 6.30. And you get four free DCast downloads per month.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Yahomer, can you take me to when you were ten to see if I can kick your butt?

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,000
 Bring it on!

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 You're superior to me in every way!

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,500
 Oh!

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
 Dad, you just destroyed your first kiss!

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 Who was it with?

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 Uh... a poo.

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 Right.

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 Is this really something I should show you kids?

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
 It's okay, we're not really your kids.

106
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 We're just representations of them that you created in your mind.

107
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
 Hey, what's going on here?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 See? That's where my memory stopped.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Oh!

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
 How can I get my memory to work?

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,700
 We can get your brain to work the same way you always get the TV to work.

112
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
 By hitting it!

113
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,900
 Duff Man?

114
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
 Duff Man?

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,700
 Duff Man!

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,000
 No!

117
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,000
 Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
 Well, if you can't stand the neural activity, stay out of the neural activator.

119
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,300
 My life is ruined.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Goodbye, cruel world!

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And goodbye, crawler world!

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Bye, Homer.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Jump and we'll carry you to heaven.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Hey, aren't trolls supposed to be under the bridge?

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Goodbye.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Come on, what are you waiting for?

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 We want to see if the splash reaches the moon.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Lights flashing before my eyes.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 A life well lived, until last night.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
 I guess I'll have to watch that now. We were planning a surprise party for you

131
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:50,340
 I'm sorry a surprise party was spoiled. Oh my god. It's like Christmas in December. Let's celebrate now

132
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,340
 Stop Homer please

133
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
 My eye

134
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,060
 Don't worry honey I'll get you an ice pack. I never hit a

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
 And my family is throwing me an awesome party.

136
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
 Oh!

137
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,300
 Oh my God, I'm not dead!

138
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,300
 Homer, this is your party!

139
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
 This is great!

140
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,300
 Oh yeah, keep it up people!

141
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
 The night is young!

142
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
 Geez, Homer, I can't believe your plan actually worked.

143
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
 What plan?

144
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
 You planned to make the surprise party a surprise again, remember?

145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
 If only I could bring...

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
 Forget what happened today.

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,100
 I got just a drink to wipe your mind clean.

148
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,300
 Don't forget me, shot.

149
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
 Fellas, if you got anything you want to say to Homer,

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,300
 that he'll never remember, say it now.

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,200
 Blue pants make you look fat.

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
 I never learned your kids' names.

153
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,900
 Hmm.

154
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,600
 The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,100
 of coming home and finding Duff Man.

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
 No doubt I'll misconstrue that

157
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,300
 as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my bro.

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,100
 Oh, I'm a genius.

159
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,700
 But there are still a few things I don't understand.

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
 Like...

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,760
 Why did March lie to Chief Wiggum about how she got that black eye?

162
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,800
 Because I didn't want him finding out about the party.

163
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,520
 The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.

164
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,720
 Because you never feed him, walk him, or let him out to pee.

165
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,960
 Oh yeah.

166
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,960
 What's an angry dog?

167
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,360
 To a man I'm happy to call my best friend Homer Simpson.

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
 Aren't you going to drink?

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,120
 No.

170
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,840
 This is a moment I want to remember.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Oh.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,580
 Oh, I love going to aquatic parks.

173
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,220
 Sure, they have worse rides than amusement parks,

174
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,920
 less fish than aquariums, but the parking is ample.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,840
 Oh, there's so many photo ops.

176
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,460
 But I already filled up my camera in the parking lot.

177
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,980
 Parking lot sea sign, the tram, a license plate from Canada,

178
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,020
 a bird eating potato chips, my feet walking.

179
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,480
 Oops. I erased them all.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I want to do that.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I'm going to take stuff from the lost and found.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Attention, Exploronauts.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 That's us.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 In one minute, we'll be starting our rock-quatic roll-tacular.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Hurry! If we don't get a seat in the splash zone, I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You can come with us or sit here on the shark bench.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 You know, I did sit on a shark once.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Dead bathing suit!

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,560
 suit yes oops no bathing suit here's the original octo mom slime

190
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,840
 looks kind of uncomfortable wouldn't you be if you were saltwater fish in a

191
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,200
 freshwater aquarium the country has its first black president maybe it's time

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,080
 for the first octopus president

193
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,880
 they'll cheer a dancing octopus but not an

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Old man complaining about everything.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Excuse me, sir. Is this seat taken? Tell me more.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 More?

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Play it cool, Grandpa. Play it cool.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It was back in World War II. I was a seaman first class on the USS World War I.

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Hey boys, these sharks can't bite us if we're on their backs.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,120
 Yeah, it's like riding a cyclone back at Coney Island

201
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,840
 Sir my name is Marshall Goldman. I'm a newspaper columnist specializing in human interest stories. You're in the newspaper business

202
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,840
 Oh something that's gonna die before I do well class

203
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,040
 It's Friday afternoon. That means it's time to find out which one of you gets to take Larry the lamb home for the weekend

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Oh, oh, oh!

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And don't forget, the lucky student gets to add his or her page to Larry's personal journal.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 This weekend, Larry will go home with...

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Please God, I need this.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Bart Simpson!

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 You're getting the lamb.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Not so fast!

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Tell the diary how special he makes you feel.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 More adjectives!

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Top of the morning, Homer. Seen the paper?

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 No, I get my news off the internet.

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Well, sir, it looks like your dad is a quotable notable.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Huh?

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Hey, I never knew you were so full of bemochte, nenne.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 What does that mean?

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It's like gechel, but with a pinch more me nek te gechel.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Yep, I may just be the best known Abraham in history.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:17,820
 Every Monday, the Tinseltown Starliner would stop at 1.17 p.m. on its way to Hollywood.

222
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,640
 But none was more memorable than Clark Gable.

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 What you're eating there?

224
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,860
 Oh, it's called Gone with the Wind.

225
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
 You can have it.

226
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,260
 It's only got one swear word and not a very good one.

227
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,540
 Gone with the Wind, eh?

228
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,580
 See ya.

229
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,080
 Garbage, garbage, garbage.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Garbage my line, garbage, garbage my line.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Clark Gable owes me a book, and he never paid me for the shoeshine.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 But his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 How come Grandpa never shares those stories with us?

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 He does all the time. He just never listens.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Hmm, well, I'm up there.

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 That's it, boy. Go to the nards.

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Clark!

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 If you're not gonna take care of...

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
 They give him to me.

240
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,000
 How come I don't get mad when I torment real animals?

241
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,300
 Larry, please don't judge our whole family by Bart.

242
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,600
 Jazz!

243
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,700
 Larry, what subgenre of jazz do you like?

244
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,700
 Fusion? Neobop? Afro-Cuban?

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,700
 Larry!

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 Gotcha!

247
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,700
 Ah!

248
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,700
 That's how I got my idea for a suitcase with wheels.

249
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,000
 From watching a commercial about a suitcase with wheels.

250
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,500
 Great stories.

251
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,900
 Take a hike!

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,640
 I've already got a college boy to turn my every word into syndicated gold

253
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
 Hmm Oh dad, I got you some scotch

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,440
 One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get well

255
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,360
 Well, well, well look who decided to visit me twice in one year

256
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,800
 You only care about me now because I'm famous. That's it. Here's your ring back ring

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,400
 What ring? It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about.

258
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,440
 Okay, I need the stupid lamb back.

259
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,280
 This isn't Larry. It's just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls. Where's the real Larry?

260
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,160
 Well, what do you care? You don't even like him.

261
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
 Of course I don't, but other people do.

262
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,880
 Hey Bart, can't wait to see Larry again.

263
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,160
 Little lamb, little lamb, Nelson loved a little lamb. He kept me nice and sane.

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Stupid grandpa! I tried to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,760
 Maybe you're not really mad at grandpa. Maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for

266
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,840
 granted all these years.

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
 Come here you.

268
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,840
 Ow! Ow! I'll kill you!

269
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,240
 I'll show grandpa. I'll find my own surrogate father full of heartwarming stories I can

270
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,400
 share with the world.

271
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
 You know, Simpson, this has truly been a lovely afternoon. Really.

272
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,080
 a hound isn't that cute he thinks he's a pack

273
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:23,960
 put the rope in your teeth it'll shut you up Larry my brother fell in the

274
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,900
 storm drain um I'm strictly an above-the-ground policeman what you

275
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
 need is the sewer cup

276
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
 Fine, what's your number?

277
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 There's no such thing as the sewer cops.

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I have a column I'd like to submit.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Pay me whenever.

280
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I'll just take this to our editor.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Well, it's a prize application form.

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 When I rode with Abe Simpson on the Tinseltown Starliner,

283
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I never dreamed his first voyage would be his last.

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 At three o'clock on Monday, Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep.

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Would someone really kill a man just to win a Pulitzer Prize?

286
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,000
 I'm finally riding the Tinseltown Starliner.

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
 I could die a happy man.

288
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 Drink up Abe.

289
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,000
 Live each moment as if someone's about to kill you.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,680
 I mean as if it's your last. Sorry my hearing aids on the fritz. The only word I heard was kill

291
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,040
 What was that? Um an elephant on a circus train bellowing for his mother

292
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
 Hey slime-o

293
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
 Yeah

294
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,800
 better run. Larry, you saved my life! You're the most wonderful stuffed lamb in the world!

295
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,840
 I'm sorry about the many things I said. We'll have the rest of the weekend...

296
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
 The older I get, the more I like the taste of hot water.

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,480
 Here comes the prize.

298
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,800
 Drop that pillow!

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It gets worse.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 No!

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Yeah.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Pathetic old fool.

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Maybe so, but I know how to play possum.

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Um...

305
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 You did good, kid. This is for the shoeshine.

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
 It's a ghost quarter, but you'll be able to spend it pretty soon.

307
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
 So, Grandpa, you really saved Dad's life?

308
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,880
 I sure did!

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,040
 Why do we have to go to the rec center? I want to play with my friends.

310
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,000
 Welcome to Shaolin Kung Fu.

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,360
 Ten thousand years of knowledge will be passed along to those whose parents have signed a permission slip.

312
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,720
 The rest of you have just purchased very expensive pajamas.

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,740
 If you doubt my skill, please feel free to attack at my signal

314
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
 My she

315
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,600
 Stop stop Juliet. This is terrible. Your art is personal and wrong

316
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,040
 I was painting with my heart, but I think her painting is very imaginative

317
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 I suppose you

318
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,720
 You'd like to teach this class.

319
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
 Yes, I would.

320
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,840
 Class, everyone please stop and admire Juliet's painting.

321
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
 I do not need this.

322
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
 See ya!

323
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,840
 What are you staring at?

324
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
 Everyone paint me twenty laps.

325
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,840
 Come on, fatty, keep up!

326
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,840
 Are your parents academics?

327
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
 Kind of.

328
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,440
 Let's do some grobin'.

329
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:58,020
 convenient

330
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
 So, what do you want to do, my pet?

331
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 My parents bought me a membership card to the Folk Art Museum.

332
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So Lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner.

333
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 She's finally doing something the book said she would.

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Won't last.

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Hey Mom, can Juliet sleep over?

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom.

337
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 I mean, queendom.

338
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 How about Equalia?

339
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Equalia.

340
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Where everyone is equal, but we're in charge.

341
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Good night, Lisa.

342
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I have a best friend.

343
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 You heard me say that, didn't you?

344
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I did.

345
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 We're still cool, all right?

346
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 We are.

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 My best friend is so cool.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Friendship is like marriage.

349
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 The key is listening.

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Also, if a dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it.

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I just said that.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Okay, honey.

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 If it's that important to you, you said it.

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I'm so excited.

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,240
 When Queen Valedictoria and Helvetica hid their beloved tuna corn from the hungry ogre Homerone.

356
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
 Remember, Juliet's family is very classy.

357
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
 So be on your best behavior.

358
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
 Use as many big words as possible.

359
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,560
 I call computer. Bart, you can have doorbell.

360
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
 Homer, isn't it wonderful that my Juliet and your Lisa have become such fast friends?

361
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,920
 If you say so, my lord.

362
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,880
 Dinner's ready.

363
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
 If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands.

364
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Attention, everyone!

365
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Lisa and I would like to perform a medley of Josh Groban's 12 most popular downloads.

366
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Juliet, I'm worried this Josh Groban is becoming a bit of an obsession for you.

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I hate Track 3. I hate it! I hate it!

368
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I'll go get her.

369
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Juliet, are you okay?

370
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I am now. Don't you see them?

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 See who?

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Our friends, the lords and ladies of Aqualia.

373
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Oh, Coqueen Salvetica and Valedictoria.

374
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 We're so glad you're finally here.

375
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Toss me a treat.

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I didn't know I could do that.

377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Please be mini pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesty's.

378
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
 Mom, please don't do that.

379
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we need to talk about Lisa.

380
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,000
 She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own.

381
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Ha ha ha. That's part for you.

382
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 We're talking about Lisa, your daughter.

383
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy.

384
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I can't see Juliet anymore. I thought you wanted me to have a best friend.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,500
 There are limits to how much two people should be together.

386
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Oh, Bart Simpson, age three.

387
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,720
 Juliet, what are you doing here?

388
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,760
 I'm running away and you're coming with me, but Equalia needs you.

389
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,760
 I need you.

390
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,520
 Okay, best friend.

391
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,880
 This is where we'll live.

392
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,520
 How did you find this place?

393
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
 My family ate here last week.

394
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,600
 It really went downhill fast.

395
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,720
 But if you just believe, any place can be a qualia.

396
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,840
 Oh no, Clamalot's is closed.

397
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,480
 I'm not surprised.

398
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
 The clam chowder smelled like soap.

399
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 Yeah.

400
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Oh, hi, I'm Martin. How's the model you and total chaos?

401
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,280
 We're two minutes away from a roll call vote on a non-binding resolution and no Azerbaijan

402
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,080
 Are you saying Lisa's not there if I know my sister and unfortunately I do she probably ran off to some lame-o

403
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,760
 make-believe castle a castle I

404
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
 Know where they are

405
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You know what I think killed this place? No one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams.

406
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 She's not here?

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Girls in our hideout!

408
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 This place is where we came after my bar mitzvah.

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 You said you weren't having one.

410
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Uh...

411
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 It was just...

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 All these pictures of seafood are making me hungry.

413
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 We'll get some cream for the peaches while you guard the prisoners.

414
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 So the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axis poise.

415
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 What comes next?

416
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 There are dragons everywhere. Green ones, Chinese ones, chubby bald ones.

417
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I like those ones! Tell me about those!

418
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 What? What's going on here?

419
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 What's this?

420
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,500
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

421
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,000
 Put the book down.

422
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Why should we, Butt Brain?

423
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Well, it looks like we're safe.

424
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Looks like. Juliette, I don't want to go to Iqualia anymore.

425
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 What do you mean?

426
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,500
 It's a special place, but I need to live in the real world.

427
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,000
 Goodbye, Juliette.

428
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 We have received your manuscript, the Chronicles of Eternal Life.

429
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 It's a good idea.

430
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Sounds promising so far.

431
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Unfortunately, it is not what we're looking for at this time.
