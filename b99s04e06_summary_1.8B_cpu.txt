Papa, Papa, Papa, come in here!
Hey, Papa's here.
Papa, I'm so scared.
There's a monster in my closet.
Oh, buddy. Shh.
It's okay, I'm here.
Monster's aren't real, my little pierogi.
But I saw it. It was big and hairy.
You just had a nightmare, buddy.
No, it was real!
I'm sure it felt that way.
But I am gonna open this closet,
and I'm gonna show you that there's nothing in there.
Don't do that, Papa!
See? Nothing...
Whoo!
Ah, hey, Chuck.
It's Pimento.

And now Nikolaj says he's too frightened
to ever sleep again, so that's just superduper.
I don't understand what he's so scared about.
If I was there to kill him, he never would've heard me.
A thing you told him several times.
God, Nikolaj is having such a rich childhood.
Can we back up?
