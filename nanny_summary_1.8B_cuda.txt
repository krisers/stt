Summary: The main character, Fran, is a talented actress who is asked to perform as Juliet in a production of Romeo and Juliet. However, Fran discovers that the producers have made a deal with another actress, Niles, to replace her in the role, knowing that Fran is an expert at Shakespeare and has a unique voice. As the rehearsals begin, Fran becomes increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with the situation, realizing that her true passion lies elsewhere. When she confronts the producers, she reveals her desire to return to her convent and write letters to her deceased husband, expressing their love and affection despite being separated for years. Despite the initial excitement and support from her friends, Niles ultimately turns her down due to concerns about her success in a theater industry that often devalues traditional femininity. Fran ultimately decides to break free from her commitment to the production and pursue her dreams outside the realm of acting, determined to create a meaningful legacy for her own characters and leave a lasting impact on the world.
