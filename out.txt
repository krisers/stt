It appears that a group of coworkers have attempted to steal a police officer's plaque, but failed due to various obstacles and challenges faced during the attempt. One of the challenges was that the警方 had an extra plaque in the evidence room, which was stored in a box marked "Cold Cases 1972," leading to confusion and disputes between the coworkers about what occurred. Despite these challenges, the employees were able to communicate and work together effectively to solve the puzzle of finding the real plaque and preventing its theft.
