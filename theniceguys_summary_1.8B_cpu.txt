The main character, a private investigator named March, is investigating a mysterious case involving the death of adult film actress Misty Mountains. Amelia, Misty's younger sister, is a minor. According to her mother, Misty's death is believed to have been caused by a car accident and the discovery of a dead body in the parking lot, leading March to believe that Amelia's uncle, John Boy, was involved in the accident and mistook her for Misty, causing her death. As a result, Amelia's sister, Tally, is also believed to be involved in the murder.
Meanwhile, a woman named Judith Kuttner calls the police to report that her daughter, Jessica, was attempting to kill Amelia. As Tally leaves her at the scene to retrieve her and fails to return, John Boy and March arrive at the scene to investigate, finding no evidence of involvement. Meanwhile, April, a neighbor of the victim, becomes suspicious and confronts John Boy, who reveals that he accidentally killed Misty by mistaking her for his girlfriend. He denies any wrongdoing, stating that it was a "mistake," and offers to make a deal to absolve himself if he helps solve the mystery surrounding Amelia and Tally.
