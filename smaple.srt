1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 My only question is, are you sure your old ass eyes are up to the challenge?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,000
 I know you're just trying to motivate me, but these old ass eyes will be reading your tombstone, son.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,500
 You have a boyish face and a big goofy grin. It's like being yelled at by a children's cereal mascot.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
 Yes, congratulations on moving on to the second round, said I, sarcastically.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
 Oh, clam it, Kevin.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Clam it.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
 Cheddar, you duplicitous bitch.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
 Alright, alright, I see you.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,000
 It was a good game though. 4A, dumbass.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Okay, you're kind of overusing that one. Maybe switch it up a little bit.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 On good note, you dick.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 That landed good.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 You ever want to do business again, my door is always open.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Well, you should close it, lest you get moths.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Gary Shaw has attempted to pry me away from the NYPD for eight years.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 When he makes his offer, I know just what I'll say.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Never's not just a crater on Mars.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Of course, it is a crater on Mars.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 That's hilarious.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It's not meant to be funny, Boyle. It's meant to be devastating.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 No.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Yes. It's simple math.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's simple math. It doesn't make any sense to switch.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 The prize is behind one of two doors. It's a 50-50 chance either way.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's two-thirds if you switch, one-third if you don't.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 The probability locks in when you make the choice.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We've been over this eight times.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Seven times. Now you can't even do simple addition.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But there won't be any wine where you're headed, George.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Unless you make it in a toilet. Toilet wine.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Cagney and Lacey's recorder concert's in an hour, and I promise that I'll...

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 No one leaves until the Cobra is brought to justice.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But they're playing up John Fong!

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I wouldn't care if they were playing actual music.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Do you want a president who struggled against all odds

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 to create this great organization,

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 or do you want a great nothing who struggled against nothing odds

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 to create nothing?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You're a terrible father.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 What?

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 You've been asleep at the wheel, man.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 What have you done to cultivate his incredible mind?

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I read to him every night.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Shakespeare? Tolstoy?

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 No, nothing that advanced.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Your God, so you're reading him Dickens?

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I was voted least friendly in high school, and here I am, a police captain.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Do you know what Mr. Popularity Vincent Mondale is doing these days?

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 He's a sociologist, for God's sake.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Sociologist Terry.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Coat! Coat!

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Jacket! Coat!

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Is this a police precinct or a Turkish bazaar?

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 The Cairn Terrier is intelligent and inquisitive with a bold personality.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 A bold personality.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We know what that's code for.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 She's a bitch.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Have no fear. Mr. Rapp is here, and he will drink three beers.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I wish you would turn the radio down.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 You think that's the radio?

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 That sounds like professional music to you?

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 All music after Mahler sounds exactly like that.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Oh, Raymond!

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Of course you have beaten me to the gym.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 You live life right.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's amazing.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Work out your legs, Jeffrey, not your mouth.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Probability doesn't kick in.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Do I have to teach you college-level statistics?

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I don't know. Do I have to teach you high school statistics?

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Do I have to teach you eighth-grade statistics?

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Do I have to teach you seventh-grade statistics?

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Do I have to teach you...

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voicemail about kindergarten statistics.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Okay, we got her meeting the mayor, her dog sitting for Beau Obama, Malala giving her an award, but no photos of lunch.

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 That's because vampires don't appear on film.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Perhaps we should be looking for a 17th-century woodblock print.

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Hello, Deputy Chief Wunsch.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 You've aged.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Kelly won't tell me anything.

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 He won't even meet with me.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Perhaps you can sneak in disguised as an old leather chair.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 They're not allowed to do that. It's against the rules.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's also against the rules to let a pile of worms wear a uniform, and yet here you stand.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So nice of you to greet us, Madeleine.

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland.

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Sticks and stones, Raymond.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Describing your breakfast?

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 What do you hope to get out of this, Madeleine?

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Let me guess. Revenge on Dorothy for killing your sister.

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 How do you like my new office? 20th floor.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Yes, I never thought I'd see you this high without a broom under you.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Go ahead and gloat, you toad.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Thank you for this honor, Deputy Chief.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Oh.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Okay.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 You're welcome.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Lunchtime is over!

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Boom! Did it!

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Ha ha! Had it both ways!

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 No regrets.

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I got your whole conversation.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 You're going to leave my precinct and my task force alone.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Or else...

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 ...your...

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 ...wunchmeat.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 You sure you want to go with that one?

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Absolutely. It's hilarious.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 All right.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 We're not going to fight her.

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 She's the devil.

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And you don't dance with the devil because you get burned.

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Also, because in Madeleine's case, she has no rhythm, and her hands are like little rat claws.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Care to sit?

115
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I'm sure you'd like to take some weight off your cloven hooves.

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Calling me the devil?

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 How original, Raymond.

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Actually, I was calling you a goat.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 You goat.

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Oh!

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So, here's how I see this going down.

122
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You plead for your job back.

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I refuse.

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 You start weeping like a war widow.

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Does that sound about right?

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Don't count your gross fish babies before they've hatched, Madeleine.

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Terry said he has some news from the office of Commissioner Wunch.

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Ugh.

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 What does that human blister want now?

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Does she intend to demote me even further?

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Or perhaps she'll transfer me to the swamps of New Jersey so I can patrol the sinkhole where she was spawned.

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I've examined his proposal.

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 There's no proof the giggle pig is a serious problem.

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So we're just supposed to wait until it turns into an epidemic.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You're like the League of Nations in 36, just hoping the Abyssinian war is over.

136
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Just hoping the Abyssinian crisis resolves itself.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 That's the lesson you draw from the fall of Addis Ababa?

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Raymond, you sound so naive.

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And you sound just like Victor Emmanuel III.

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I have no idea who's winning.

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I am.

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 The email contains a link to a video.

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I'm going to play it.

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Brace yourselves.

145
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 If it shows Madeleine, be sure not to look directly into her eyes.

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Because we'll turn to stone?

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 No, because her eyes are ugly.

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Hello, Raymond.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Surprised to see me?

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Well, I didn't say Bloody Mary.

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I'm sorry.

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 I've seen her play the movie three times, so yes.

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 When did she record this?

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Judging by the flames around her, it could be a live stream.

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Very good, Rosa.

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I bet it was the van driver.

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 You mean the woman who was thrown violently from the vehicle and just barely survived?

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Yeah, I'm sure she was very badly injured.

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Sorry if my voice is raspy.

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 They just took the breathing tube out.

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But they left the BS in?

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Good God.

163
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I'm sorry for interrupting your dinner party.

164
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 No problem at all.

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 This is important.

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Also, Kevin's friend Margo's here, and she's a real class A drip.

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I miss this place.

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Huh.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Little Cheddar's askew.

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Really made yourself at home, didn't you, Jeffers?

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Well, I for one think you're perfect for each other.

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I feel like there's gonna be more.

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Because you're both losers.

174
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 There it is.

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 None of you stand a chance against me.

176
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 No courage, no patience, no brains, and of course, a bald old man.

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I'm younger than you.

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 No comeback for the bald thing, I see.

179
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I don't think I'm the right director to bring your vision of Maxwell Blaze to life.

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 What does that even mean?

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It means you blew it.

182
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Walk away, Jeffers.

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Walk away.

184
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 You were so easily manipulated.

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Now you're stuck with Sergeant Dum Dum.

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Hey, that's not all I dip-sticked.

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Mr. Fit.

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Or shall I call you by your real name, Mr. Fib?

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 You would take the loser's side, Jeffers, you bitch.

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Trash talk.

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Okay.

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I don't like this.

193
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I'm gonna go.

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Sir, this is clearly Zuma's case.

195
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And that's a good thing.

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 You can finally say goodbye to your nemesis.

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Thanks, Sergeant.

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That's a nice thought for an idiot to have.

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 All right, guys.

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 This fanboy stuff is a little much.

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 The only thing that's a little much about this is that it's a little too much.

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 The only thing that's a little much around here are your scrawled-on eyebrows.

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Yeesh.

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Much like Sisyphus, condemned to push the same boulder up the same hill day in and day

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 out.

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 You know, according to French philosopher Albert Camus, Sisyphus achieved happiness

207
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 in that absurd repetition.

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Any French philosophy post-Rousseau is essentially a magazine.

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Yerube.

210
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 How dare you disobey me.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Come on, sir.

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It was a good tip, and we're trying to catch a serial killer.

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Well, then, let's see this tip, this groundbreaking tip that threatens the bloodline of the American

214
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 people.

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Let's blow the case wide open.

216
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Okay.

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I know this tone.

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Here comes Petty Holt.

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Nah, bitch.

220
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I'm not being petty.

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 You just said, nah, bitch.

222
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Show me the tip.

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 When people say good morning, they mean hello.

224
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 When people say how are you, they mean hello.

225
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 When people say what's up, they mean I am a person not worth talking to.

226
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I spent 14 years bringing down a Mexican cartel.

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 You know what they gave me for it?

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 A letter of commendation with my last name misspelled.

229
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 In all fairness, Bob, who spells Anderson with three Ns?

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I know everyone's mad at Peralta for ruining their weekend.

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 But?

232
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 That was it.

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I was just demonstrating for Detective Peralta what a fact is.

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I don't want to hear you bad mouthing my replacement around the office.

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Do it surreptitiously.

236
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Watch this.

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I hear the new captain's a pill popper.

238
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They're on their way up.

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Everyone hide your pills.

240
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I don't know where Garibaldi is, all right?

241
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 It's not like we were close.

242
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I was just his trainer at the gym.

243
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Then why were you always going out to dinner with him?

244
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Was he doing reps of Linguini?

245
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Noice.

246
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Good Lord.

247
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Where did he get that?

248
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Oh, my God.

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 We're doomed.

250
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I'm sorry.

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I'm sorry.

252
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I'm sorry.

253
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I'm sorry.

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I'm sorry.

255
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I'm sorry.

256
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,500
 Boyle looks like a lesbian.

257
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,840
 You sir are not ready to scramble eggs.

258
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
 Hand over your spatula.

259
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
 Fine.

260
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,880
 I only wish in return I could get back all the time I just wasted on this futile project.

261
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,880
 I'm just going to make Kevin plain toast for breakfast.

262
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,340
 Oh, that is low.

263
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,840
 The only thing you won last heist was a lifetime of mediocre heterosexual intercourse with

264
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
 Jake.

265
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,220
 How dare you?

266
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,840
 No one thinks you won last year.

267
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
 Wow.

268
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,340
 Really thought the how dare you was going to be linked to his mean sex comment, but

269
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
 okay.

270
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
 Right.

271
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
 Sorry.

272
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
 Here are two pictures.

273
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
 One is your locker.

274
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,520
 The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines.

275
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,760
 Can you tell which is which?

276
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
 That one's the dump?

277
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
 They're both your locker.

278
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 God, I should have guessed that.

279
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
 He's good.

280
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
 I'm sorry.

281
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
 I'm sorry.

282
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
 I'm sorry.

283
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 I'm sorry.

284
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
 I'm sorry.

285
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 I'm sorry.

286
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
 I'm sorry.

287
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,220
 I'm sorry.

288
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,280
 Forget it.
