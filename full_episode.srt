1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Oh

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,460
 Was it as good for you as it was for me actually Niles I was faking it

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,580
 Oh

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,620
 Hi sweetie see some of the kids are going to the Hamptons for the weekend. Oh great. Will there be boys there?

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,500
 Maybe a few fun parents. Who cares? They'll just get in the way anyway

6
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,800
 Go have a blast. We don't have enough to tell your father

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,020
 Really? Oh sure and when I'm fired and you're in the convent, we'll write each other letters and laugh about this

8
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,620
 But Maxwell, how can you say no to working with Philippe? He's an avant-garde genius

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,660
 Guilty as charged and I've put a new twist on the tragedy

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,300
 We follow Romeo and Juliet to heaven and have a happy ending

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,180
 You're really writing one of the greatest love stories of all time. We're adding a few scenes, but we're taking out others

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,900
 Which ones the ones that don't work?

13
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,180
 Well, I'm sorry fully but we British have a thing about mutilating Shakespeare the Queen comes and hits you with her purse

14
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,060
 But I bet you have a big name to star. I'm looking for an unknown a fresh face with a unique voice

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,420
 I found my Juliet

16
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,900
 She was working in a bridal shop and flashing Queen's till her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes

17
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,900
 What was she to do? Where was she to go? She was out on her fanny

18
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,900
 So over the bridge and flashing to the Sheffield's door. She was there to sell makeup but the father saw more

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,900
 She had style, she had flair, she was there. That's how she became the nanny

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
 Who would have guessed that the girl we described

21
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
 Was just exactly what the doctor prescribed

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
 Now the father finds her reguiling, watch out Cece

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,900
 And the kids are actually smiling, such what a thing

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,900
 She's the lady in red when everybody else is wearing tan

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,900
 The flashy girl from Flushing, the nanny named Fran

26
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,900
 Can you imagine anything more ridiculous than me doing Shakespeare?

27
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
 Well yes, people paying to see it

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,900
 I'll have you know that in high school I played the Reverend Mother in the Sound of Music

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,900
 I put a low scoop neck into my nun's habit and those hills were alive

30
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,900
 We did the Sound of Music, I played the Baroness

31
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
 It was an all-boys school

32
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,900
 Thank God I didn't play the guitar, I would have been Maria

33
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
 Fran, you can't be in the play

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,900
 Yeah, who would do our laundry, clean our room? We don't have standing foot

35
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,900
 Well, the same person that always does, Niles

36
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,900
 Besides if I do it, it would only be for a couple of weeks

37
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,900
 Actually, I could rehearse while the kids are at school

38
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
 I think not

39
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,900
 Why think you not? I could use a life outside of this house

40
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,900
 Me too, which is why you should let me go to the Hamptons

41
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
 Nice try, forget it

42
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,900
 Look Miss Fine, taking care of the children is a full-time job

43
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
 Oh and I suppose it was my idea to have three?

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
 What you do in your spare time is entirely your own affair

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
 I'm simply trying to protect you from having an embarrassing theatrical experience

46
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,900
 We know what that's like, don't we sir?

47
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,900
 You know, if some people aren't a little more supportive

48
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,900
 I might omit them from my Oscar speech

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
 Tony, Miss Fine, you'd win a Tony, not an Oscar

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,900
 Actually, for an off-Broadway performance, Miss Fine would win the OB

51
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
 She's not going to win anything

52
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,900
 Well, thank you for that vote of confidence, that's it

53
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,900
 I'm playing Juliet and nothing is going to stop me

54
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
 And I'm going to the Hamptons

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
 Sit down Margaret

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
 I'm going to the Hamptons

57
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
 Sit down Margaret

58
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
 Okay

59
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,900
 Okay Niles, will you play Romeo?

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
 Isn't he too old?

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,900
 Well actually, Juliet's supposed to be my age so it's not like Franz

62
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
 Not perfect for the role

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,900
 I warn you, my acting prowess may blow you off the stage

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,900
 They're still talking about my baroness

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,900
 I can't stop thinking about it and I didn't even see it

66
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
 And I spent my summers in Stratford upon Avon

67
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,900
 I spent my summers selling Avon

68
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,900
 Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

70
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,900
 Niles, don't I come in here somewhere?

71
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
 Anon, anon, beauty too rich for use for a...

72
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
 Alright, back off baroness

73
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
 And by the way, you're supposed to dust the scenery, not chew it

74
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
 Well, could they show me how it's done, Mistress Fine?

75
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,900
 Well, I will if you'll just shut it up if...

76
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,900
 Oh, for a falconer's voice to lure this tassel gentile back again

77
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,900
 It's gentle, not gentile

78
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
 How should I know? Did I look down his tights?

79
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,900
 I still can't understand why Philippe would hire Miss Fine to play Juliet

80
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
 Please, only an idiot would hire her to do anything

81
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
 In the theater

82
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,900
 Oh, oh, Mr. Sheffield, if you've got a minute I could use your help

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
 That's the understatement of the century

84
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,900
 Meanwhile, if we put an apple in his mouth we can have a luau

85
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
 Let me see

86
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
 Oh, I just love this play

87
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,900
 More torches here, ah, sirrah, by my fey it waxes late

88
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
 See, that's exactly what I'm talking about

89
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
 With Alice Faye and why she waxing during a party

90
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
 Good luck

91
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
 Shall I play Romeo to your Juliet?

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,900
 Four, three, two, what took you so long?

93
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
 All right, so now we're star-crossed lovers

94
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,900
 Let's get some physical realism into this, shall we?

95
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
 Oh, Mr. Sheffield

96
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
 No, I mean I'm going to put you on your balcony

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
 Oh, okay

98
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,900
 All right, now Juliet is dreaming of her Romeo

99
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
 And she says...

100
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
 I'm a

101
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,900
 Oh, speak again, bright angel

102
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
 Oh, Romeo, Romeo

103
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,900
 Yes, no, maybe we could have a little more lilting

104
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
 Just a bit more melodic

105
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
 Oh, sure, sure, sure, melodic

106
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
 Oh, Romeo, Romeo

107
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,900
 Yeah, just a little too melodic, I think

108
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
 Let me show you

109
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
 Okay, sure, he's going to show us

110
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,900
 Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

111
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,900
 Deny thy father and refuse thy name

112
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,900
 Wow, you British guys really know how to play women

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
 We did this play in college

114
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,900
 Oh, you must have been the perfect Romeo

115
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
 No, I was Friar Lawrence, actually

116
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,900
 That's the problem going to school with Jeremy Irons

117
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
 All right, let's go on

118
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
 Okay

119
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,900
 Romeo, def thy name and take all of me

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,900
 I take thee at thy word

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,900
 Call me but love and I'll be new baptized

122
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,900
 You know, if I were directing this I'd go in a whole different direction

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
 Good night, good night

124
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,900
 Parting is such sweet sorrow

125
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,900
 Sleep dwell in thine eyes, peace in thy breast

126
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,900
 How would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest?

127
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,900
 You know, because this Slubby-Dubby stuff has just been done to death

128
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
 You know?

129
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
 Much better

130
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,900
 Yeah, I think I'm starting to get the hang of it now

131
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,900
 Of course I'm going to need a lot of coaching

132
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,900
 I'm going to suck out all your blood and bury you alive

133
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
 You don't scare me

134
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,900
 All right, fine, I'm the Cici Monster

135
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,900
 And I'm going to marry dad and send you away to boarding school

136
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
 We're just going to play a game

137
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
 But I'm going to get you at the end of the game

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
 And then we're going to have a game

139
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
 That's right

140
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
 You scare me!

141
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,480
 All right, fine. I'm the Cece Monster.

142
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,980
 And I'm gonna marry Dad and send you away to boarding school!

143
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,020
 Ah!

144
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,980
 Ah!

145
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,860
 Children! Children! Children!

146
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,860
 Be quiet!

147
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,200
 Geez, Dad, you don't have to scream about it.

148
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,700
 Look, I already sent you to bed five times.

149
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,040
 What are you doing still up?

150
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,080
 Well, I'm not tired.

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 Well, maybe that has something to do with the pound of chocolate

152
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,580
 I told you not to eat.

153
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,260
 You know, I think it was a gallon of cola you told me not to drink.

154
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,880
 And what's your excuse?

155
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,620
 Well, he took me in wrong.

156
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,960
 Obviously. You got out.

157
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,420
 Now, come on. Off the bed, both of you.

158
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,140
 Just give me one good reason why I can't go to the Hamptons.

159
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,760
 I won't let you.

160
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,760
 Look, Margaret, you're much too young to go away for the weekend.

161
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,340
 By the time Juliet was my age,

162
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,720
 she had already gotten married, had sex, and died.

163
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,740
 Well, now you see what happens when you don't listen to your father.

164
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,660
 Niles, I'm thinking of changing the children's bedtime.

165
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
 Oh, to when, sir?

166
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,200
 Right after school.

167
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,200
 I can't believe Miss Fine isn't back yet.

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,460
 I can't believe what's happened to my roast.

169
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,080
 It's starting to bear a strange resemblance to Hume Cronin.

170
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,040
 I mean, how much rehearsal can one person need?

171
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
 Oh, right.

172
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,160
 But still...

173
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,960
 Oh, hi, guys. For sooth, am I.

174
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,160
 Poop.

175
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,580
 Dinner is coming right up.

176
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,620
 Oh, Niles, I already ate.

177
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,160
 You couldn't have called?

178
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
 Well... Never mind.

179
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
 Ruined, anyway.

180
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,000
 Boy, is he moody.

181
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,800
 Well, you are rather late.

182
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,720
 What are you two on, the same cycle?

183
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,760
 What's the problem?

184
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,140
 Oh, you couldn't handle the kids?

185
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,340
 Oh, don't make me laugh.

186
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,180
 What, do you think the minute you leave, the entire house falls apart?

187
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
 Oh, well...

188
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,980
 No, don't go in there.

189
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,720
 Why not?

190
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,300
 We can use the back stairs. They're closer.

191
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,980
 No, they're not.

192
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,520
 Yes, they are.

193
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,060
 Oh, not?

194
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,060
 Oh, so I measured.

195
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,100
 OK.

196
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
 Too slow.

197
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,140
 Oh, my God.

198
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,440
 Oh, this place looks worse than when my mother ransacked my bedroom

199
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,360
 and I'm looking for my diary.

200
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,320
 Well, I was looking for my glasses.

201
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
 What do you have, a reading emergency?

202
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,900
 So, what were you doing all evening?

203
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,700
 I was at rehearsal.

204
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,700
 Well, I called. Rehearsal was over at eight.

205
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,740
 Well, we went out after.

206
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
 Who's we?

207
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,700
 Oh, you know, Romeo, Mercutio, Tybalt, the gang.

208
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,080
 Oh, I'm sorry. It was an accident.

209
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,040
 So was that.

210
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,080
 Boy, you leave the house for a couple hours,

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,960
 you come back and it's a pigsty.

212
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,500
 Yeah, well, maybe if you'd been here,

213
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,000
 your children wouldn't have been running amuck.

214
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 Oh, so when they're sweet, adorable angels,

215
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,380
 they're your children, and when they're amuck, they're mine.

216
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,840
 Well, you are the nanny.

217
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,160
 And that's all you want me to be.

218
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,080
 Now I'm getting one of my headaches.

219
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,540
 You know what I think?

220
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,300
 You are jealous because Philippe discovered something

221
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,060
 that was right under your nose.

222
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,060
 And what would that be exactly?

223
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,060
 My star quality.

224
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,180
 That's rather like discovering the atomic bomb.

225
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,800
 Sounds good in theory, but millions will suffer.

226
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,440
 Well, that's it. I'm going home to my mother.

227
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,220
 No, don't bother. I'm sleeping on the couch.

228
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,900
 If we're splitting up, I get Niles.

229
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,640
 At least you couldn't afford him.

230
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
 Not on what you pay me.

231
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,940
 It's always the butler who suffers.

232
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
 Oh.

233
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,900
 I'm working.

234
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
 Pretend I'm not here. That's how I get through the day.

235
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,100
 Oh, hello, Niles.

236
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,020
 Would you mind telling Mr. Sheffield that I'm going to rehearsal?

237
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,440
 Unless, of course, he'd like me to sit by his feet and peel him a grape.

238
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,520
 Well, that's my job, but you can wave the fan.

239
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,860
 Well, you can tell the nanny

240
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,560
 that I wouldn't dream of standing in the way of her aspirations,

241
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,140
 no matter how ludicrous they might be.

242
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,320
 Well, tell Mr. Sheffield that I am a ground woman

243
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,940
 and can find fulfillment any way I choose

244
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,440
 and that he is a duty head.

245
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,320
 To synopsize her, you are a duty head.

246
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,480
 So that's the one you choose to repeat.

247
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,480
 Translate as prerogative.

248
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,220
 I don't think I've ever met a more infuriating, irritating woman.

249
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,760
 Hello, hello.

250
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,100
 Think hard, sir.

251
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,800
 I just heard the most delicious news.

252
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,800
 Well, why don't you run, make a friend and tell them all about it?

253
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,720
 Philippe needs a tax write-off, so he wants the show to flop.

254
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,300
 That's why he cast Nanny Fine, to guarantee a total disaster.

255
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,020
 I knew it!

256
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,180
 I knew she had no talent.

257
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,400
 People will be walking out in the middle of her performance.

258
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,060
 Just like one of your dates.

259
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,320
 Well, we can't tell her. She'll be crushed.

260
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
 I know.

261
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,940
 On the other hand, if I don't tell her,

262
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,240
 then she'll be publicly humiliated opening night.

263
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,240
 I know. It's a win-win situation.

264
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,520
 Maggie, if you want to go to the Hamptons,

265
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,980
 you're going to have to ask your father

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,600
 when he's watching Masterpiece Theatre.

267
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,140
 Yes, just when his chin drops down to his chest,

268
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,520
 but before he starts snoring.

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,060
 Well, sure, that's how I got my raise.

270
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,940
 We're doing the death scene. Places, everybody.

271
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,400
 Oh, Maggie, I gotta go.

272
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,440
 I gotta go plunge a knife into my heart.

273
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,400
 Boy, I'm sounding more like my mother when I'm in the bathroom.

274
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
 Boy, I'm sounding more like my mother every time.

275
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,740
 Oh, uh, Philippe, I gotta ask you a question.

276
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,080
 I don't know what my motivation is here.

277
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,980
 Why does Juliet kill herself?

278
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,860
 Because without her Romeo, she has no reason to live.

279
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,040
 Oh. You could tell this play was written by a man.

280
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,660
 I don't know how she got this part.

281
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,500
 Well, she must be sleeping with him.

282
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,160
 I slept with him. I got two lines.

283
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,540
 I got Romeo.

284
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,780
 Okay.

285
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,860
 Romeo, drink your poison.

286
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,160
 Here's to my love.

287
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,120
 Thy drugs act quick, thus with a kiss.

288
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,860
 I die.

289
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,980
 Now, Juliet awakens.

290
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,820
 Aye, what a night.

291
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,660
 Oh, Romeo, I see poison.

292
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,200
 I see poison hath been your timeless end.

293
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,540
 Oh, Cheryl.

294
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,080
 Oh, happy dagger, this is thy sheath.

295
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,660
 There rust and let me die.

296
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,000
 Ah!

297
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,160
 Ah!

298
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
 Ah!

299
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,160
 Ah!

300
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,780
 Ah!

301
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,460
 Ah!

302
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,080
 Ah!

303
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,700
 Ah!

304
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,340
 Ah!

305
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,040
 Ah!

306
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,800
 Ah!

307
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,580
 Oh!

308
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
 Oh!

309
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,660
 Hey! Hey!

310
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
 Oh!

311
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,340
 Ah!

312
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,960
 Ah!

313
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,620
 Ah!

314
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,220
 Ah!

315
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
 Ah!

316
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 She's perfect.

317
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,060
 This play will die faster than she does.

318
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,940
 Aye.

319
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,700
 And now Romeo and Juliet ascend to heaven.

320
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,740
 My Lord Romeo.

321
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,680
 I follow thee to heaven.

322
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,480
 Whoa!

323
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060
 Whoa!

324
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
 Hi! Hey!

325
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,820
 You guys!

326
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
 Heaven on God away!

327
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,240
 Whoa!

328
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,660
 Whoa!

329
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,400
 Whoa!

330
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,820
 Hey!

331
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,700
 Oh!

332
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
 Whoa!

333
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,900
 Hey!

334
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,080
 Oh!

335
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,620
 Whoa!

336
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,500
 Oh, boy!

337
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,840
 Don't worry!

338
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,040
 I'm okay!

339
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,040
 Oh, but it looks like Romeo's got quite a wedgie going on.

340
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
 Bye!

341
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
 Hi.

342
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,220
 Hi.

343
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,640
 Gee, you know, that harness really chafes.

344
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,560
 Boy, that Mary Maughan must have had to hide like a rhino.

345
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 Hey, I know you.

346
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,520
 Well, I have done six Broadway shows and several national tours.

347
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,520
 No, no, it was a commercial.

348
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,520
 You're the less than fresh girl!

349
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,200
 Oh, Mr. Sheffield!

350
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 Who are you, sir?

351
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
 I'm the new lady.

352
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
 No, you're not!

353
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
 You're not!

354
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,200
 People! People, please!

355
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,080
 Come on, back off!

356
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
 I'm not!

357
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,520
 Come on, back off!

358
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,640
 Get away! Let the man breathe!

359
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
 Give her some air!

360
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 Sheesh!

361
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,100
 God, she's sleeping with everybody!

362
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,720
 Watch, next year she'll have her own sitcom.

363
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,860
 Miss Fine, I owe you an apology.

364
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,900
 You owe me an apology?

365
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,480
 Oh, yeah, right.

366
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,200
 I was selfish and thoughtless, and I'm extremely sorry.

367
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,740
 Oh, thank you, Mr. Sheffield.

368
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
 I'm sorry I called you a duty head.

369
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,120
 Apology accepted.

370
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,040
 You know, we shouldn't fight anymore. It's so hard on Noyles.

371
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
 Yeah, I know.

372
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,420
 Listen, I need to talk to you about this play.

373
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,840
 Maybe you'd better sit down.

374
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
 Oh, okay.

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,680
 I think I know what you're gonna say, though.

376
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 No, I doubt that.

377
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
 Yes, I do.

378
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,340
 You're gonna say that you and the kids really need me at home,

379
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,560
 and the mansion is a mess,

380
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,600
 and I don't belong in this play,

381
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,020
 and, well, you'd be absolutely right.

382
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,680
 I would?

383
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,900
 Yeah, isn't that what you were gonna say?

384
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,900
 Oh, yes, yes, that was exactly what...

385
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,900
 You read my mind.

386
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,320
 Our clairvoyance runs in my family.

387
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,320
 I got an ampoule of the predicted Hurricane Andrew.

388
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,580
 For the first time in history,

389
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,320
 there wasn't a single Jew on Miami Beach.

390
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,100
 Come on. I'm gonna take you home.

391
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,640
 I just thought that Philip isn't too disappointed.

392
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,640
 I mean, he really was counting on me.

393
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,980
 Well, Miss Fine, a talent like yours

394
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,980
 doesn't come along every day.

395
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,360
 True.

396
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,560
 But you know, between you, me, and the Pillars,

397
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,400
 that Philippe is not the greatest director in the world.

398
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,600
 And if I'm gonna make my big Broadway debut,

399
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,400
 I should do it right.

400
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,520
 I should do it right.

401
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,560
 In one of your plays.

402
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,060
 Oh.

403
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
 Now back to Masterpiece Theater, part 26,

404
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,940
 The Lords of Thisbury.

405
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,360
 Psst, Maggie, make your move.

406
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,860
 Hi, Dad.

407
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
 Oh.

408
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,220
 Are you asleep?

409
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,120
 Mm, no.

410
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,420
 Are you gonna let me go to the Hamptons?

411
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,060
 Mm, sure, honey.

412
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,360
 When Miss Fine gets her next raise.

413
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,440
 Ever since Alastair Cook left, he doesn't sleep as well.

414
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,320
 Oh!

415
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
 Lunch!

416
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,020
 Oh, good.

417
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,860
 Hello?

418
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,360
 People?

419
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
 Oh, people.

420
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,660
 We're fought on, everyone.

421
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,600
 Hello?

422
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,000
 Hi.
