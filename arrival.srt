1
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,691
<i>I used to think</i>

2
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,461
<i>this was the beginning
of your story.</i>

3
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,570
<i>Memory is a strange thing.</i>

4
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,141
<i>It doesn't work
like I thought it did.</i>

5
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:53,846
<i>We are so bound by time,
by its order.</i>

6
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,335
Okay.

7
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,177
Okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,812
Come back to me.

9
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,815
Come back to me.

10
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,583
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,255
Are you the sheriff
in this here town?

12
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,491
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna getcha!

13
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,226
No!

14
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,763
You want me to chase you?
You better run!

15
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,301
Ah!
Oh!

16
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,485
<i>I remember
moments in the middle.</i>

17
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,523
I love you.

18
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,792
I hate you!

19
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,839
<i>And this was the end.</i>

20
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,577
Shhh...

21
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,684
Come back to me.

22
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,552
You come back to me.

23
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,436
<i>But now I'm not so sure</i>

24
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,638
<i>I believe in beginnings
and endings.</i>

25
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,776
<i>There are days that define
your story beyond your life.</i>

26
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,513
<i>Like the day they arrived.</i>

27
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,426
Good morning.

28
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,428
Morning.

29
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,733
Where is everyone?

30
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,503
Okay. Well,
let's get started.

31
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,406
Today we are talking
about Portuguese

32
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,508
and why it sounds so different

33
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,810
from the other
romance languages.

34
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:43,348
The story of Portuguese begins
in the kingdom of galicia...

35
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,351
Sorry.

36
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,620
In the middle ages,

37
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,391
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

38
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,633
Any news you want to share?

39
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,970
Dr. banks, can you turn
the TV to a news channel?

40
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,456
<i>But police have
already set up a blockade</i>

41
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,724
<i>here around the area.</i>

42
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:25,724
<i>As you can see,</i>

43
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:29,494
<i>we've got just about
as close as we can,</i>

44
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:29,494
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

45
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,864
<i>Montana right now
is on complete lockdown.</i>

46
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,001
<i>The object apparently
touched down 40 minutes ago,</i>

47
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,936
<i>just north of i-94.</i>

48
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,539
<i>We're waiting to hear
if this is perhaps</i>

49
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,342
<i>an experimental vessel or...</i>

50
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,477
<i>Hold on, it...</i>

51
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,514
<i>I'm learning that more objects
like this have landed in</i>

52
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,550
<i>as many as eight other locations</i>

53
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,618
<i>around the world.</i>

54
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,487
<i>Yes, can we?</i>

55
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,757
<i>This is from a site in hokkaido.</i>

56
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,494
<i>This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.</i>

57
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,402
Okay. Um...

58
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,372
I'm sorry.
Class is dismissed.

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,481
You are an idiot!
You drove right into me!

60
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,952
You just ruined my car!

61
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,822
<i>For now, we're simply
asking for cooperation</i>

62
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,957
<i>while authorities
assess the object.</i>

63
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,560
<i>So, you're saying it's not ours?</i>

64
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,028
<i>Do you even know
if it's from earth?</i>

65
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,563
<i>We're still collecting
information.</i>

66
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,831
<i>We're coordinating
with other countries.</i>

67
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,766
<i>We're not the only ones to</i>

68
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,968
<i>have one of these
in our backyard.</i>

69
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,071
<i>If this is some sort
of peaceful first contact,</i>

70
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,807
<i>why send 12?</i>

71
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,608
<i>Why not just one?</i>

72
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,188
Yeah, I know.
I saw that, too.

73
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,159
Uh-huh.

74
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,066
Uh-huh. I don't know, mom.

75
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,869
I'm watching the same
news coverage you are.

76
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,976
Well, mom, please don't
bother with that channel.

77
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,545
How many times
do I have to tell you?

78
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,913
Those people are idiots.

79
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,551
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

80
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,221
Okay. Exactly. So...

81
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,024
Um, me? Yeah, um,
you know me.

82
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm about the same.

83
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,099
Mom, I'm fine.

84
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,836
Okay, I'll call you later.
Bye.

85
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,515
<i>And around eight
hours after landing,</i>

86
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,650
<i>there are still no signs
of what might be called</i>

87
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:38,650
<i>"first contact."</i>

88
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:43,788
<i>Now, the objects measure
at least 1,500 feet tall...</i>

89
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,525
<i>Two are reported</i>
<i>to have penetrated</i>
<i>Russian airspace.</i>

90
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,928
<i>One in Siberia, and the other
off the coast of the black...</i>

91
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,763
<i>above the ocean.</i>

92
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,132
<i>So far, there are
12 unidentified objects</i>

93
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:54,132
<i>spread across the globe.</i>

94
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:58,203
<i>There is no obvious logic
to their locations</i>

95
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,006
<i>and no evidence that
the ships are even occu...</i>

96
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,676
<i>entertain the idea that
if it is a kind of vessel,</i>

97
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>it may be unmanned.</i>

98
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,148
<i>Regardless, we have</i>
<i>a protocol for</i>
<i>scenarios like this.</i>

99
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,885
<i>After Tuesday's
extraordinary events,</i>

100
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,989
<i>the president this morning has
declared a state of emergency,</i>

101
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,890
<i>with as many as
5,000 national guard</i>

102
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,126
<i>being deployed to
the state of Montana alone.</i>

103
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,762
<i>Borders are closed and
flights have been grounded,</i>

104
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,731
<i>stranding millions of travelers.</i>

105
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,033
<i>Panic buying of gas,
water and food</i>

106
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,901
<i>continues to escalate,</i>

107
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,770
<i>and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted</i>

108
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>all caps on overtime
for law enforcement.</i>

109
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,776
<i>The atf has put a temporary
ban on new gun licenses,</i>

110
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,911
<i>forcing many
independent suppliers of</i>

111
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,980
<i>hunting equipment and firearms</i>

112
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,982
<i>to close their doors
to the public.</i>

113
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,318
<i>Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...</i>

114
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,753
Two days...

115
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,821
<i>from the site of the 12 ufos.</i>

116
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,189
And already,
the public expects us

117
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,125
to know the answers.

118
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,127
I'm colonel g.T. Weber.

119
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,929
We never formally met,

120
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,931
but two years ago, you did
some Farsi translations

121
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,333
for army intelligence.

122
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:08,333
Oh.

123
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,270
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

124
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,706
You made quick work
of those insurgents.

125
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,911
You are on the top of
everyone's list

126
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,213
when it comes to translations.

127
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,084
And you have another
two years in your ssbi,

128
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,219
so you still have
top-secret clearance.

129
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,690
That's why I'm
in your office and
not at Berkeley.

130
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,159
Okay.

131
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,969
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

132
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,313
<i>Why are you here?</i>

133
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,885
<i>Can you...
Can you understand us?</i>

134
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,794
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

135
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,207
Now you heard it.
What do you make of it?

136
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,145
Is that...

137
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,880
Yes.

138
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,884
How many?

139
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,286
How many what?

140
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,022
Um, how many, um, speaking?

141
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,293
Two.

142
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,165
Assume they were not
speaking at the same time.

143
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,368
Are you sure?
Did they have mouths...

144
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,972
How would you approach
translating this?

145
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,976
Do you hear any words?
Phrases?

146
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,047
I don't...
I don't know.

147
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,916
So what can you tell me?

148
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,152
I can tell you that
it's impossible

149
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,187
to translate from an audio file.

150
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,323
I would need to be there,
to interact with them.

151
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,326
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

152
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,263
I didn't need it because
i already knew the language,

153
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,398
but this...
This is... ah...

154
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,836
I know what you're doing.

155
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,037
Tell me what I'm doing.

156
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,037
I'm not taking you to Montana.

157
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,874
It's all I can do
to keep it from turning
into a tourist site

158
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,176
for everybody who
has a ts clearance.

159
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,211
I'm just telling you
what it would take

160
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,813
to do this job.

161
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,281
This is not a negotiation.

162
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:40,084
If I leave here,
your chance is gone.

163
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,828
Good day.

164
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,563
Colonel?

165
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,899
You mentioned Berkeley.

166
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,235
Are you going to
ask danvers next?

167
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,503
Maybe.

168
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,105
Before you commit to him,

169
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,909
ask him the sanskrit word
for war and its translation.

170
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,186
<i>An agreement on sharing
scientific discoveries</i>

171
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,955
<i>looks closer tonight,</i>

172
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,524
<i>as Russia and China join talks
at the united nations.</i>

173
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,127
<i>Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis</i>

174
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,363
<i>as the dow Jones
industrial average fell</i>

175
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,098
<i>over 2,000 points...</i>

176
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:45,950
Morning.

177
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,051
Colonel?

178
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,153
<i>Gavisti.</i>

179
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,155
He says it means
"an argument."

180
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,891
What do you say it means?

181
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,359
A desire for more cows.

182
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,060
Pack your bags.

183
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,130
All right.
Give me 20 minutes?

184
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,498
Takeoff in ten.

185
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,434
Dr. banks.
Right this way, please.

186
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,252
<i>Contact and ready to approach...</i>

187
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,922
Excuse me, Dr. banks,
let me make sure
you're properly secured.

188
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,331
You okay?

189
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,375
<i>Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.</i>

190
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,378
<i>"Language is the foundation
of civilization.</i>

191
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,981
<i>"It is the glue</i>
<i>that holds</i>
<i>a people together.</i>

192
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,717
<i>"It is the first weapon
drawn in a conflict."</i>

193
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,987
<i>Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.</i>

194
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,521
<i>Louise banks, Ian Donnelly.</i>

195
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,190
<i>That's quite a greeting.</i>

196
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,192
<i>Yeah, well, you wrote it.</i>

197
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,127
<i>Yeah.</i>

198
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,363
<i>It's the kind of thing
you write as a preface.</i>

199
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,465
<i>Dazzle them with the basics.</i>

200
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,601
<i>Yeah, it's great.
Even if it's wrong.</i>

201
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,104
<i>It's wrong?</i>

202
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,406
<i>Well, the cornerstone of
civilization isn't language,</i>

203
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,008
<i>it's science.</i>

204
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,544
<i>Ian is</i>
<i>a theoretical physicist</i>
<i>from los Alamos.</i>

205
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,681
<i>You'll be reporting to me,
but you'll be working with him</i>

206
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,282
<i>when you're in the shell.</i>

207
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:58,516
<i>That's what
they're calling the ufo.</i>

208
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:04,088
<i>Priority one: What do</i>
<i>they want and where</i>
<i>are they from?</i>

209
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,557
<i>And beyond that,
how did they get here?</i>

210
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,260
<i>Are they capable of
faster-than-light travel?</i>

211
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,697
<i>I've prepared a list of
questions to go over,</i>

212
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,165
<i>starting with a series of</i>

213
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,134
<i>"handshake" binary sequences...</i>

214
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,635
<i>How about we just talk to them</i>

215
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,204
<i>before we start throwing
math problems at them?</i>

216
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,509
<i>This is why you're both here.</i>

217
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,212
<i>I'll bring the coffee.</i>

218
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,417
<i>Coffee with some aliens.</i>

219
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,782
I want you to take
these two to Dr. kettler.

220
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,684
Yes, sir.

221
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,386
Follow the captain to medical.

222
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,188
It should take
just a few minutes,

223
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,356
and then we'll get started.

224
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,604
We'll take care of
your bag. I'll take
your cell phones.

225
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,573
Cell phones!

226
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,609
Follow me.

227
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,478
Put these on. You're gonna
wear them at all times.

228
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,726
Sir, they're here.

229
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,395
Louise banks?
Ian Donnelly?

230
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,297
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

231
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,632
Last night.
Same.

232
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,534
Last time you did
something stressful?

233
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,369
Does now count?

234
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,239
Just saying...

235
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,941
Uh, who was being carted off
in the medevac?

236
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,578
Not everyone is able to
process experiences
like this.

237
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm gonna get
some blood from you

238
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,349
and give you
an immunization dose

239
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,551
that covers a battery
of bacterial threats.

240
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,687
Could you sign these, please?
And roll up your sleeves.

241
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,256
Either of you claustrophobic?

242
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,657
No.
No.

243
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,360
Currently taking
any medications?
Allergies?

244
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,794
Pregnant?

245
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,429
No.

246
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,565
The booster is
a kick to your system,

247
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,767
so you may experience
some side effects,

248
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,502
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

249
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,272
a ringing in your ears,
like you have tinnitus.

250
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,340
They wouldn't go, either way.

251
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,551
You see what's happening to him?

252
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:27,551
How does this even work?

253
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,288
<i>The readings do not change,</i>

254
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,288
<i>but I don't know,</i>

255
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,758
<i>it's like we're insects
on a piece of paper,</i>

256
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,926
<i>and they're easing us
out of the house.</i>

257
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,763
<i>At exactly 112 minutes
and 19 seconds,</i>

258
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:42,433
<i>gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.</i>

259
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,403
Have you found
a scientific explanation
for it?

260
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,804
Like, is it for them?

261
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,773
<i>Uh, no.
We think it's for us.</i>

262
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,609
<i>Air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,</i>

263
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,412
<i>so after about two hours,
we run out of oxygen.</i>

264
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,915
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air
into a room.

265
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,617
Atmosphere...

266
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,720
Excuse me?

267
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,889
If their atmosphere is
different from earth,

268
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,457
it would certainly take hours

269
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,726
to rebalance their O2 content
and pressure for us

270
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,728
every time they open their door.

271
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,364
So, they could suffocate us
if they wanted.

272
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,499
This is agent halpern
with the CIA.

273
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,601
Let me get you two
to your stations.

274
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,903
Yes, sir.

275
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,739
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

276
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,607
What do they want?
Where are they from?

277
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,942
Why are they here?

278
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,410
This is the priority.

279
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,412
Everyone, this is
Dr. Ian Donnelly.

280
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,014
He'll be running this team here.

281
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,383
Have they responded to anything?

282
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,919
Shapes, patterns,
numbers, fibonacci?

283
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,354
We can't tell
what they're saying

284
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,389
when they respond
to "hello," so...

285
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,958
Don't get ahead of yourself.

286
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,829
What have you figured out?

287
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,932
We're just getting started.
Good morning!

288
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,935
This is Dr. Louise banks.
She'll be heading your team.

289
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:50,935
It's a pleasure meeting you.

290
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:55,072
Dr. banks is
taking over the mission
from Dr. Walker.

291
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,510
That's a 15-minute warning.

292
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,112
You scuba-dive before?

293
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,684
What kind of
radiation exposure
are we walking into?

294
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,986
Nominal. These are
just for safety.

295
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,789
So, is there any physical
contact with the, um...

296
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,658
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

297
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,594
There's a wall.
Like, a glass wall.

298
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,396
You can't get to them.

299
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,433
So, what do they look like?

300
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,602
You'll see soon enough.
Hurry up.

301
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,090
<i>The suits are clumsy at first,</i>

302
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,559
<i>but you get used to them.</i>

303
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,662
<i>I'll open a second vehicle.</i>

304
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,005
<i>We'll be there in a few minutes.</i>

305
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,174
<i>Make sure you hold on
to something.</i>

306
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,000
<i>Copy, condor. We will observe,
but not initiate. Over.</i>

307
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,169
Watch your step.

308
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,172
<i>We'll keep
Alpha channel open. Over.</i>

309
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,908
<i>Alpha, be advised.</i>
<i>Humidity increased</i>
<i>since yesterday.</i>

310
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,943
<i>Every 18 hours,</i>

311
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,179
<i>the door opens up at the bottom.</i>

312
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,583
<i>That's where we go in.</i>

313
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,996
<i>Zero movement.</i>
<i>Alpha detail,</i>
<i>clear to proceed. Over.</i>

314
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:32,196
<i>Copy, condor.</i>

315
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:35,232
<i>Beginning our ascent now.
Over.</i>

316
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,740
<i>Ten feet.</i>

00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,145
<i>Five feet.</i>

318
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,882
<i>Two, one...</i>

319
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,036
<i>Alpha clear to enter
antechamber.</i>

320
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,713
<i>Moving into position.</i>

321
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,591
<i>Thirty feet from target.</i>

322
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:37,861
<i>Suit telemetry</i>
<i>now full strength,</i>
<i>despite unknown interference.</i>

323
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,739
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

324
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,863
<i>Oxygen level: 20.3%.</i>

325
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,366
<i>No known contaminates. Over.</i>

326
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,314
<i>Radio signals are decreasing.</i>

327
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,350
<i>90%, 85%...</i>

328
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,038
Yeah, that just happened.

329
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,693
<i>All right, let's move!</i>

330
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:16,894
<i>Time is wasting.</i>

331
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,030
<i>You ready? You ready?</i>

332
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,866
<i>Let's do it!</i>

333
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,036
<i>Condor, I'm proceeding first
with captain marks, over.</i>

334
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,879
<i>Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over!</i>

335
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,082
<i>It's all good, sir.</i>

336
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,883
<i>You can proceed.</i>

337
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,319
<i>Stand by!
Okay, bring it up.</i>

338
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,892
<i>Vitals are low.</i>

339
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,196
<i>Radio signal strength
stable at 75%. Over.</i>

340
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,799
You okay?

341
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,770
Yeah.

342
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,339
Dr. banks?

343
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,279
<i>You can do this. Come on.</i>

344
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,148
<i>I don't know. I... I think...</i>

345
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,492
<i>Grab her.</i>

346
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,006
<i>Donnelly, are you all right?</i>

347
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,276
Dr. Donnelly, you good?

348
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,213
<i>Dr. Donnelly,
are you all right?</i>

349
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,282
<i>Please respond. Over.</i>

350
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,017
<i>Yeah.</i>

351
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,022
<i>Holy fuck!</i>

352
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,162
<i>We're gonna go down there,</i>

353
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:01,031
<i>and you're gonna start your job.</i>

354
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,833
<i>Okay.
Okay?</i>

355
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,034
<i>Okay.</i>

356
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:04,034
<i>Everybody, move out!</i>

357
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,970
<i>Alpha detail is in position.</i>

358
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,505
<i>Team is in position.</i>

359
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,174
<i>We're on the move.</i>

360
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,088
<i>Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.</i>

361
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,924
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

362
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,393
So, what happens now?

363
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,964
They arrive.

364
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,229
<i>Dr. banks?</i>

365
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,303
Dr. banks?

366
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,173
You can start.

367
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,679
<i>In airlock.</i>

368
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,515
<i>Do not stop until you have
passed the airlock door.</i>

369
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,551
<i>Do not attempt to
remove Hazmat suits</i>

370
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:10,520
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

371
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,189
<i>Repeat: Hazmat suits</i>

372
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:15,192
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

373
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,127
Wait. Just a minute.
Just a minute.

374
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,174
Clear.

375
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,409
- All right.
- Step on out, please.

376
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,643
Now hold that.

377
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,448
Am I fired?

378
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,284
You're better than the last guy.

379
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,754
That doesn't
make me feel any better.

380
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,558
You both have till
02:00 hours to
figure something out.

381
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,161
Okay. What happens then?

382
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,130
You go back in.

383
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,765
<i>Violence continues to spread</i>

384
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,735
<i>across the us today in
the wake of the 12 landings.</i>

385
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,203
<i>The president has declared</i>

386
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,205
<i>a mandatory
dusk-to-dawn curfew</i>

387
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,374
<i>after the crackdown
by the national guard failed</i>

388
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:40,243
<i>to prevent a third night of
looting across the country.</i>

389
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,280
<i>In north Dakota, 144 members of</i>

390
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,115
<i>the Saint Lawrence
pentecostal cult</i>

391
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:48,118
<i>are feared dead after they set
their compound ablaze.</i>

392
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,520
<i>Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens</i>

393
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,355
<i>set in motion a prophesy that...</i>

394
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,278
Uh, we're up in 15.
You got any new intel?

395
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,382
<i>Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.</i>

396
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,118
Where does that get you?

397
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,719
<i>Well, they play audio
back at us,</i>

398
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:25,122
<i>from an unseen source.</i>

399
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,556
Audio of what?

400
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,792
<i>Uh, it's bits of conversation
from the room.</i>

401
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,760
<i>Random clips of dialogue.</i>

402
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,231
<i>Really, we have nothing.</i>

403
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,136
<i>T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.</i>

404
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:41,138
<i>T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.</i>

405
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,163
<i>T-minus 9 minutes
to shell access.</i>

406
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:09,232
<i>T-minus 9 minutes
to shell access.</i>

407
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,700
<i>What's that for?</i>

408
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,702
<i>A visual aid.</i>

409
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,539
<i>Look, I'm never</i>
<i>gonna be able to</i>
<i>speak their words,</i>

410
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:15,539
<i>if they are talking,</i>

411
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,177
<i>but they might</i>
<i>have some sort of</i>
<i>written language</i>

412
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,179
<i>or basis for
visual communication.</i>

413
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,614
<i>Okay.
Let's get started.</i>

414
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,959
<i>Human.</i>

415
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,455
<i>"Human."</i>

416
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:12,662
<i>I'm human. What are you?</i>

417
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,575
<i>Human.</i>

418
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,993
<i>Oh my god!</i>

419
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:16,993
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

420
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:20,764
<i>Yes, sir!</i>
<i>It's uploading</i>
<i>back to base camp.</i>

421
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,568
<i>Louise, that's incredible.</i>

422
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,885
<i>Human.</i>

423
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,021
<i>Human.</i>

424
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,956
<i>Human.</i>

425
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,471
<i>Okay, slow down now.</i>

426
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,740
<i>Slow down.</i>

427
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,</i>

428
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,795
<i>but Dr. banks,</i>
<i>is this really</i>
<i>the right approach?</i>

429
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,065
<i>Trying to teach them
how to speak and read?</i>

430
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,000
<i>That's gotta take longer.</i>

431
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,471
<i>You're wrong. It's faster.</i>

432
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:40,510
Everything you do in there,
i have to explain to
a room full of men

433
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,412
whose first
and last question is...

434
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,514
"How can this
be used against us?"

435
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,150
So you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

436
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,420
Kangaroo.

437
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,655
What is that?

438
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,557
In 1770,

439
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,059
captain James cook's ship
ran aground

440
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,527
off the coast of Australia,

441
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,396
and he led a party
into the country,

442
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,964
and they met
the aboriginal people.

443
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,665
One of the sailors pointed at

444
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,534
the animals that hop around

445
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,569
and put their babies
in their pouch,

446
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,937
and he asked what they were,

447
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,140
and the aborigine said,
"kangaroo."

448
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,909
And the point is?

449
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,044
It wasn't till later
that they learned that

450
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,881
"kangaroo" means
"i don't understand." So,

451
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,050
I need this so that we don't
misinterpret things in there.

452
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,753
Otherwise, this is gonna
take 10 times as long.

453
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,890
I can sell that for now.

454
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,427
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary words

455
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,795
before the next session.

456
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,430
Fair.

457
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,965
And remember what happened
to the aborigines.

458
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,903
A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out.

459
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,745
It's a good story.

460
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,146
Thanks.

461
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,816
It's not true.

462
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:54,951
But it proves my point.

463
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,070
<i>We think
we were able to reproduce</i>

464
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,940
<i>some prime number
sequences back at them.</i>

465
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:18,641
<i>So that's something.</i>

466
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,977
Well, congratulations.
You're a parrot.

467
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,679
<i>It's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard,</i>

468
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:23,847
<i>don't you see?</i>

469
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,882
<i>They can't seem to
follow our algebra,</i>

470
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,853
<i>but complex behaviors,
that clicks.</i>

471
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,759
Well that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

472
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,799
Problem is,
not everyone shares
our policy

473
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,868
of being open with the aliens.

474
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,903
Have you met general shang?

475
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,138
The call sign for him
is big domino.

476
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,573
Whatever shang does,

477
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,642
at least four other nations
will follow.

478
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,677
Louise? We have to
gain ground today.

479
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,079
Okay.

480
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,981
You have a vocabulary list
for me?

481
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,649
I do.

482
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,056
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

483
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,758
Yes, so that we can learn

484
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,560
their names if they have names,

485
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,662
and then introduce
pronouns later.

486
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,030
These are all
grade-school words:

487
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,533
Eat, walk.

488
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,603
Help me understand.

489
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,139
Okay. Um...

490
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,278
Oh, no, no, no!
Not the top!

491
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,985
Okay, this is where
you wanna get to, right?

492
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,687
That is the question.
Okay.

493
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,889
So, first, we need to
make sure that

494
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,025
they understand
what a question is.

495
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:45,962
Okay, the nature of
a request for information

496
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,697
along with a response.

497
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:51,901
Then, we need to clarify
the difference between

498
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,104
a specific "you"
and a collective "you,"

499
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:59,275
because we don't wanna know
why Joe alien is here,

500
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,245
we want to know
why they all landed.

501
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,848
And purpose requires
an understanding of intent.

502
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,150
We need to find out:

503
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,152
Do they make conscious choices?

504
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,754
Or is their motivation
so instinctive

505
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,624
that they don't understand
a "why" question at all?

506
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,125
And... and biggest of all,

507
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,595
we need to have enough
vocabulary with them

508
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,229
that we understand their answer.

509
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,767
I get it.

510
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,869
Stick to your list.

511
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,338
Just

512
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,208
don't add anything to it.

513
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,824
<i>Are at 2.97.</i>

514
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,959
<i>Oxygen level: 21.4%. Over.</i>

515
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,695
<i>Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.</i>

516
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:55,632
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

517
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,100
Let's get started.

518
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:11,114
<i>Louise. Louise.
I am Louise.</i>

519
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,656
<i>What is that?</i>

520
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:21,791
<i>Is that a new symbol?
I can't tell.</i>

521
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:26,062
<i>I don't know. I think it's
the symbol for human again.</i>

522
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,798
<i>It just has a little
curl on the end,</i>

523
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
<i>maybe to indicate a question.</i>

524
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:32,235
<i>I don't know.</i>

525
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:33,670
<i>I don't know, Louise.</i>

526
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,005
<i>I think
they're getting confused.</i>

527
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,840
<i>Dr. banks,</i>

528
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,876
<i>perhaps we should
move on to the next word.</i>

529
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,729
<i>Dr. banks!</i>

530
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,165
<i>It's okay.</i>

531
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,266
<i>What's going on?</i>

532
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,834
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

533
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,102
Yeah, I'm fine.

534
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,870
<i>Are you insane?</i>

535
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,872
They need to see me.

536
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,374
<i>She's taking off
her Hazmat suit.</i>

537
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,111
Is it okay?

538
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:16,345
<i>You're risking contamination.</i>

539
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:17,980
They need to see me.

540
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:19,415
<i>Dr. banks...</i>

541
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:19,415
<i>Dr. banks.</i>

542
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:23,086
<i>She's walking
towards the screen.</i>

543
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,890
<i>Should we abort?</i>

544
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,059
<i>Recourse noted.
Stand by for further orders.</i>

545
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,829
<i>Go back to your stations.</i>

546
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,873
Now that's
a proper introduction. Hey.

547
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,920
Louise.

548
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,057
I am Louise.

549
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,294
Ian, do you want to
introduce yourself?

550
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,264
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

551
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,237
Louise.

552
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,576
<i>Screw it!</i>

553
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,448
<i>Everybody dies, right?</i>

554
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:38,020
<i>Sir, Donnelly is
taking off his Hazmat suit.</i>

555
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,089
<i>Permission to abort?</i>

556
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,858
<i>Continue the session.</i>

557
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,508
Ian.

558
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,210
Louise.

559
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,247
You...

560
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,216
Who are you?

561
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,245
I think those are their names.

562
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,550
They have names.

563
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,086
So, what are we gonna call them?

564
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,588
I don't know.

565
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,225
I was thinking
abbott and costello.

566
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,529
Yeah.

567
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,398
Yeah?
Yeah, I like it.

568
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,069
I like it.

569
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:01,437
Wow!

570
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,185
<i>Team 1, exit your vehicle</i>

571
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:19,956
<i>and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.</i>

572
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:29,498
<i>Leave your respirator on until
you reach the equipment room.</i>

573
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,396
I know. Shhh!

574
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,005
<i>Team 2, exit your vehicles</i>

575
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:12,441
<i>and continue to
the decontamination tent.</i>

576
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,143
<i>Leave your respirators on</i>

577
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:15,711
<i>and do not hesitate</i>

578
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,646
<i>until you have reached
the equipment room.</i>

579
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,351
<i>How do you feel?</i>

580
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,187
Overworked.

581
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,289
Well, I guess
i don't need to tell you

582
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,691
you're putting yourself at risk.

583
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,361
There's no signs of
radiation poisoning yet.

584
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,197
We'll see how
your blood tests look.

585
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,700
For now, I'm gonna
give you another boost.

586
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,301
Okay.

587
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,203
No radiation.

588
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,039
Nothing else
we can detect either,

589
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,408
but I'd give them a strong
cocktail, regardless.

590
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,277
It's the first time
we've made
significant progress.

591
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,749
All right.
We'll take the risk.

592
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,317
Okay, honey...

593
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,619
<i>What is going on there?</i>

594
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,054
Honey...

595
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,221
<i>Just tell me!</i>

596
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,223
You don't need to worry, okay?

597
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,558
<i>How can I not worry?</i>

598
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,060
Just calm down.

599
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,561
Just calm down.

600
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,465
<i>Becky asked me</i>
<i>if the monsters are</i>
<i>going to kill daddy!</i>

601
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12,168
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

602
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,138
<i>Just stay safe.</i>

603
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,473
You don't need to worry.

604
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:19,542
<i>Please! I'm so scared!</i>

605
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,613
<i>All junior xenolinguistics</i>

606
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,782
<i>and science personnel

<i>general curfew

<i>Curfew in effect

<i>Effective immediately,</i>
<i>midnight rations</i>
<i>will be served all night.</i>

612
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,518
<i>Here are some of the many things</i>

613
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,586
<i>we don't know about heptapods.</i>

614
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:41,290
<i>Greek.</i>
<i>Hepta, "seven."</i>
<i>Pod, "foot."</i>

615
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,626
<i>Seven feet. Heptapod.</i>

616
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:45,328
<i>Who are they?</i>

617
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:49,598
<i>Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way</i>

618
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,467
<i>is hampered by the fact that,</i>

619
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:54,470
<i>outside being able to see them
and hear them,</i>

620
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:57,606
<i>the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.</i>

621
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,845
<i>The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown.</i>

622
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,282
<i>The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.</i>

623
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,552
<i>Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,</i>

624
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:12,288
<i>they do so without detection.</i>

625
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,757
<i>The air between the shells
is untroubled</i>

626
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,792
<i>by Sonic emission or light wave.</i>

627
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,829
<i>Are they scientists?
Or tourists?</i>

628
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,431
<i>If they're scientists,</i>

629
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,700
<i>they don't seem to ask
a lot of questions.</i>

630
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,239
<i>Why did they park
where they did?</i>

631
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:33,676
<i>The world's most decorated
experts can't crack that one.</i>

632
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:35,444
<i>The most plausible theory is</i>

633
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:35,444
<i>that they chose places on earth</i>

634
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:39,582
<i>with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.</i>

635
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,617
<i>But there are exceptions.</i>

636
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,719
<i>The next most
plausible theory is that</i>

637
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,454
<i>sheena Easton had a hit song</i>

638
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,889
<i>at each of these sites in 1980.</i>

639
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,691
<i>So, we just don't know.</i>

640
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,729
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

641
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,832
<i>Here, Louise is
putting us all to shame.</i>

642
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,634
<i>The first breakthrough was</i>

643
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:01,403
<i>to discover that
there's no correlation</i>

644
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:05,274
<i>between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.</i>

645
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,491
<i>Unlike all written
human languages,</i>

646
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:24,927
<i>their writing is semasiographic.</i>

647
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:28,597
<i>It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.</i>

648
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,304
<i>Perhaps they view
our form of writing</i>

649
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,673
<i>as a wasted opportunity,</i>

650
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:40,376
<i>passing up a second
communications channel.</i>

651
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,350
<i>We have our friends
in Pakistan to thank</i>

652
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:51,420
<i>for their study of
how heptapods write,</i>

653
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:55,424
<i>because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.</i>

654
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,362
<i>Like their ship or their bodies,</i>

655
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:02,731
<i>their written language
has no forward</i>

656
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:02,731
<i>or backward direction.</i>

657
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:08,437
<i>Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,</i>

658
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,640
<i>which raises the question,
"is this how they think?"</i>

659
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,612
<i>Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,</i>

660
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:16,612
<i>starting from either side.</i>

661
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:21,517
<i>You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,</i>

662
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,420
<i>as well as how much space
they would occupy.</i>

663
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,624
<i>A heptapod can write
a complex sentence</i>

664
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:30,826
<i>in two seconds, effortlessly.</i>

665
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,762
<i>It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.</i>

666
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:36,865
<i>Next, expanding vocabulary.</i>

667
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,667
<i>Louise thinks it could
easily take another month</i>

668
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,336
<i>to be ready for that.</i>

669
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,355
Hey...

670
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,924
Oh, hey.

671
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:04,360
Weber's looking for you.

672
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:06,995
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

673
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,032
Come on up!

674
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,669
Thanks.

675
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,640
Nice out here, huh?

676
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:21,009
Yeah, it's a nice view.

677
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,379
Away from the noise.

678
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,617
You know, I was just
thinking about you.

679
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,589
You approach language
like a mathematician.

680
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:36,825
You know that, right?

681
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,094
I will take that
as a compliment.

682
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,729
Yeah, well, it is.

683
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:46,769
As I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

684
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,904
that I didn't even know existed,

685
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,739
it's like, "what?"

686
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,843
I guess that's why I'm single.

687
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:57,980
Trust me, you can
understand communication

688
00:56:57,982 --> 00:56:59,748
and still end up single.

689
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:12,594
I feel like everything
that happens in there

690
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,530
comes down to the two of us.

691
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,600
Yeah, that's a good thing
though, right?

692
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,035
You and I?

693
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:26,875
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

694
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,577
Thank god I've got you!

695
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:39,722

That's you and dad.

Yeah.

01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,843
You know, I was doing
some reading, um,

754
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,244
about this idea

755
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:59,781
that if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

756
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:02,317
then you can actually
rewire your brain.

757
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,386
The sapir-whorf hypothesis.

758
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,388
Mm-hmm.

759
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,123
The theory that, uh...

760
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,192
It... it's the theory
that, uh,

761
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:12,027
the language
you speak determines

762
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,428
how you think and...

763
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,064
Yeah. It affects
how you see everything.

764
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,399
It was, uh...

765
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,868
I'm curious...

766
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,137
Are you dreaming
in their language?

767
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,016
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

768
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,155
I don't think that that
makes me unfit to do this job.

769
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,776
Did you sleep?

770
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:01,977
A little.

771
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,279
Do you know mandarin?

772
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,051
It is shifting.

773
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,194
The voice you're about to hear

774
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:21,530
belongs to
a Chinese military chief...

775
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,066
General shang.

776
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,535
Pull it up!

777
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,207
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

778
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,209
if you want to look.

779
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,877
Wait, go back.

780
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,880
Stop.

781
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,818
He's saying that each of the 12

782
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,886
is offering advanced technology.

783
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,291
Go back again.
And play.

784
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,427
Um...

785
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:57,032
"Our science team
is attempting
to decode the sets."

786
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,035
"Sets." I don't know
what that means.

787
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,970
Something about advantage,

788
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,506
suits, honor and, uh, flowers.

789
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,208
I don't...

790
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,177
I don't know. That's all.

791
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,980
I don't know
what it means either.

792
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:14,149
An hour ago,
China mobilized forces.

793
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:16,985
And now, Russia's
following suit.

794
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:19,120
Shang's about to
start something.

795
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:21,189
Following suit. Suits.

796
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,927
Suits, honor, flowers...

797
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,597
Colonel, those are
all tile sets in mah-jongg.

798
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,300
God, are they...

799
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:35,503
Are they using a game
to converse with
their heptapods?

800
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,274
Maybe. Why?

801
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:42,878
Well, let's say that
i taught them chess
instead of English.

802
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,946
Every conversation
would be a game.

803
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:48,083
Every idea expressed through
opposition, victory, defeat.

804
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,417
You see the problem?

805
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,219
Hmm...

806
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,488
If all I ever gave
you was a hammer...

807
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,490
Everything's a nail.

808
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,294
We need to ask the big question.

809
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,163
Ready or not.

810
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,279
Yeah, I know,
but between
there and there.

811
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,216
Well, it's time to go.

812
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,506
Okay...

813
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:51,046
Heptapods' purpose.

814
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:04,192
Heptapod purpose earth.
What is your purpose?

815
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,301
Do we only have costello?

816
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,608
Okay. There you are.

817
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,598
What does it say?

818
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,042
Offer weapon.

819
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,081
You saw what they wrote!

820
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,383
Using a word
they don't fully understand.

821
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,118
Could be a request.
A warning.

822
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,121
Enough! Louise?

823
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:08,223
We don't know if they understand

824
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:11,192
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

825
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,161
Our language, like
our culture, is messy,

826
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,662
and sometimes, one can be both.

827
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,231
And it's quite possible

828
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,500
that they're asking us
to offer them something,

829
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:20,101
not the other way around.

830
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:22,270
It's like the first
part of a trade.

831
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,239
So, how do we clarify
their intentions

832
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,573
beyond those two words?

833
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:25,573
Well, I go back in.

834
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:28,610
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

835
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:30,412
It's more complicated than that.

836
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:33,214
How is it more complicated
than that?

837
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,383
Colonel,
the secretary of defense

838
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,118
is on the line for you.

839
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,627
We need to sit
on this information

840
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:47,228
till we know what it means,

841
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,197
so we aren't sharing it
with our enemies.

842
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:49,197
We must consider the idea

843
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:52,634
that our visitors
are prodding us to
fight among ourselves

844
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,303
until only one faction prevails.

845
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,305
There's no evidence
of that.
Sure there is.

846
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,674
Just grab a history book.

847
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:03,445
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

848
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:06,081
They even got
a name for it in Hungary.

849
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:15,457
Yeah. We're a world
with no single leader.

850
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:17,225
It's impossible to
deal with just one of us.

851
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,594
And with the word
"weapon" now...

852
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:23,398
Halpern. Yes, sir!

853
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,619
No confirmation yet.
Standing by.

854
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:48,623
Anything?
What did they say?

855
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,292
China and Russia
are off the grid.

856
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:51,292
They aren't speaking to anyone.

857
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:56,364
Whatever they learned
in their last session
has them spooked.

858
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,467
Yes, sir!

859
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,369
We have orders to do the same.

860
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,570
These are our allies!

861
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:03,771
You can't shut us down!

862
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,573
Put us on radio silence.
Do it.

863
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:09,310
We received a message
from the hept... damn it!

864
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,746
We need to be
talking to each other!

865
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:14,616
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.

866
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,756
<i>Base-camp talk
is now offline.</i>

867
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:24,292
<i>All interpreters and
international liaisons,</i>

868
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:28,196
<i>stand down and
report to unit coordinators.</i>

869
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,433
We've never
re-entered a session before.

870
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:35,203
Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

871
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,405
We've just gotta
step on it, all right?

872
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,440
<i>"Use weapon."</i>

873
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:39,440
<i>This is the alien message</i>

874
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:43,244
<i>said to have provoked
the Chinese government</i>

875
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:44,879
<i>to withdraw
their scientists from</i>

876
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,614
<i>the international mission today.</i>

877
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,850
<i>In a statement,
general shang said,</i>

878
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,219
<i>"China no longer trusts
the aliens</i>

879
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:52,587
<i>"who want to divide us.</i>

880
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:55,390
<i>"Humanity must be protected."</i>

881
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:58,193
<i>China has asked for immediate
talks at the un.</i>

882
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,864
<i>Alpha-one-niner,</i>

883
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,532
<i>this is condor, over.</i>

884
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,607
<i>Alpha-one-niner,</i>
<i>this is condor,</i>
<i>come in. Over.</i>

885
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,248
<i>Captain marks, condor
not receiving transmission.</i>

886
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,450
<i>Squelch twice if you hear line.</i>

887
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,286
<i>Captain marks, all escort units</i>

888
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:26,988
<i>are ordered to
cease all activity.</i>

889
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,954
No, no, no. Dr. banks,
you can't go in there.

890
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:01,923
I just need to ask one question.

891
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,359
Dr. banks!
The session
is finished.

892
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:06,494
You can't... you can't go
back in. It's dangerous.

893
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,396
Look, we just need
five minutes. Don't sweat it.

894
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,298
Marks, let them go.

895
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,836
Hey, abbott!

896
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,910
So, what are we calling
this? Session 37?

897
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,580
Uh, no, 36, part 2.

898
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,489
Why are they on their own?

899
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:36,824
We've been attempting
to hail captain marks.

900
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,693
The escort units
are not responding, sir.

901
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:41,863
Why not? Send security.

902
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,903
"Offer weapon,
question mark."

903
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,511
Are you offering us something?

904
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:07,989
Technology, apparatus, method?

905
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,391
Yeah, see,
this is a different word.

906
01:12:10,393 --> 01:12:13,061
This... this segment,
it's a lot busier.

907
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,969
Give technology

908
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,972
now.

909
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,550
What's he doing?

910
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,490
<i>Captain, on your ten.</i>

911
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,601
<i>Security detail inbound, sir.</i>

912
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:56,371
<i>T-minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.</i>

913
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:58,473
<i>Okay, this is it.
Lock and load.</i>

914
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,742
<i>We just need to
hold them off until it's done.</i>

915
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:03,411
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Warning shots</i>
<i>and suppressive fire only.</i>

916
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:03,411
<i>Load up and get to cover.</i>

917
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:06,881
<i>Stay frosty and
we can avoid casualties.</i>

918
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,943
Abbott wants me to
write on the barrier.

919
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,784
Can you even do that?

920
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,787
I don't know.

921
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,571
I can't do it with both hands.

922
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,711
Louise...

923
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,160
What is that?

924
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,242
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

925
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:24,111
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

926
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,183
How do you feel?

927
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,859
How is Ian?

928
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:41,062
Same as you. He's okay.

929
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:45,132
Who, um...
Who did this?

930
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,001
Ah, some soldiers.

931
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:49,270
They've been watching
too much TV.

932
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,941
What is that?

933
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,743
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

934
01:16:55,745 --> 01:17:00,114
The site's no longer
secure. We're standing by
to evacuate.

935
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,116
Where's Ian?

936
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,086
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

937
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:07,955
He wouldn't leave until
he knew you were okay.

938
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,760
Your whole tent is on the clock

939
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:15,663
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

940
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:22,837
This is all of it?

941
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:25,339
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

942
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,876
Not as far as I can see.

943
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,812
You see something?

944
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,280
Oh, I don't know yet.

945
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:36,217
I'm gonna need my team to get
together with Louise's team.

946
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,918
I need everybody
working on this.

947
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,353
We cannot leave.

948
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:39,353
Glad to see you're awake.

949
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:43,824
We need to go
back in and explain
this wasn't our fault.

950
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,860
We can't go back inside.
We have to.

951
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:48,195
What happened in there
was an attack.

952
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:48,195
We can hope for the best,

953
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:50,865
but I have orders to
prepare for retaliation.

954
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,299
We may have to evacuate.

955
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:52,299
No, that's the wrong move.

956
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:55,803
As long as they stay,
we have to stay.

957
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:31,972
Well, they're not leaving.

958
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,876
Why does this feel worse?

959
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,383
<i>China is on the offensive.</i>

960
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,218
<i>They're positioning the military</i>

961
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,986
<i>to blow the alien vessel
right out of the sky.</i>

962
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:47,855
<i>And if this happens,</i>

963
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:49,223
<i>we can't sit around
waiting for retaliation.</i>

964
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,925
<i>So, get prepared.</i>

965
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:54,161
<i>The air force and infantry
are standing by.</i>

966
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:55,229
Yes, sir.

967
01:18:56,832 --> 01:19:00,401
<i>Tonight, China becomes
the first world power</i>

968
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:03,237
<i>to declare war
against the aliens.</i>

969
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,940
<i>Following the failure of
diplomatic efforts</i>

970
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,408
<i>at the united nations,</i>

971
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,878
<i>China has confirmed that its
language experts have tonight</i>

972
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,280
<i>delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.</i>

973
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:13,280
<i>In a televised statement,</i>

974
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:17,952
<i>general shang, chairman of
the people's liberation army,</i>

975
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:21,789
<i>said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory</i>

976
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,124
<i>or face destruction.</i>

977
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:25,326
<i>And he urged
all other world leaders</i>

978
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:28,429
<i>to unite with China
and take a similar stance.</i>

979
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:33,067
<i>With a huge buildup of forces
at their landing sites,</i>

980
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:35,903
<i>Pakistan, Russia and Sudan
are thought to be</i>

981
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:37,471
<i>following China's lead.</i>

982
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,222
It can't be random.

983
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,907
It's going to take us years.

984
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,880
<i>What's this term here?</i>

985
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,885
<i>Mom...</i>

986
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,056
Mom...

987
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:30,491
Hmm? Sweetie...

988
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,927
Uh, what's this term
for that thing,

989
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,895
like a...
Like a technical term,

990
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:36,363
where we make a deal,

991
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,432
and we both
get something out of it.

992
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,301
A compromise.

993
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:41,836
No...

994
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,104
Like, it's a competition.

995
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:45,840
Mm-hmm...

996
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:47,341
But both sides end up happy.

997
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:50,110
Like a win-win.

998
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,279
More science-y than that.

999
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:55,382
If you want science,
call your father.

1000
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,131
Thank you.

1001
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,544
Sorry.

1002
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:25,012
It's okay.

1003
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:26,981
I'm up.

1004
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,353
What time is it?

1005
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,962
It's time you opened that
bottle you've been hiding.

1006
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:43,097
You cracked something,
didn't you?

1007
01:21:43,099 --> 01:21:44,365
Yeah. Come here.

1008
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,935
Take a look at this section.

1009
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:50,571
It seems to be
talking about time.

1010
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:53,307
Their symbol for time
is everywhere.

1011
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:54,975
So what is this?

1012
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,446
A formula for
faster-than-light travel?

1013
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,582
Who can tell?

1014
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,317
There are too many gaps.

1015
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:04,985
Nothing's complete.

1016
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:06,453
Then it dawned on me.

1017
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:08,122
Come here.

1018
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,958
Right here.

1019
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,929
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.

1020
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,931
How much of this is data?

1021
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,466
How much of it
is negative space?

1022
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,435
So, I measured it.

1023
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,539
0.0833 recurring.

1024
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,014
Perhaps you'd
like that as a fraction.

1025
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,719
One of twelve.

1026
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:45,125
What they're saying
right here is that
this is one of 12.

1027
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,094
"We are part
of a larger whole."

1028
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:49,263
Or we're one of
12 contestants
for the prize.

1029
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:50,664
Why do I have to talk to him?

1030
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,232
We're all working together.

1031
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:54,535
We need to talk to
the other sites,

1032
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:57,237
help them with what they've
gotten from the heptapods.

1033
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:58,439
We're blacked out.

1034
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:00,674
China just threatened
to destroy their shell.

1035
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:00,674
We're on our own.

1036
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,644
But this says that all of
the pieces fit together.

1037
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,612
And I'm telling you
that no one else cares.

1038
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:06,146
Two hours ago,

1039
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,450
we pulled this audio off
a secure channel in Russia.

1040
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:12,252
Someone on the science team
there was broadcasting wide.

1041
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,391
<i>In their final session,
the aliens said,</i>

1042
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:20,461
<i>"there is no time.
Many become one."</i>

1043
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:23,163
<i>I fear we have
all been given weapons.</i>

1044
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:27,001
<i>If anyone is receiving this,
please...</i>

1045
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,408
Well, I mean,

1046
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,044
there are a lot of ways

1047
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:38,412
you can interpret what he said.

1048
01:23:38,414 --> 01:23:40,547
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

1049
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:42,683
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

1050
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:42,683
to keep their secret.

1051
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:46,553
"Many become one" could
just be their way of saying

1052
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:48,422
"some assembly required."

1053
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:50,290
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

1054
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,092
Why not just give it all over?

1055
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:54,361
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

1056
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:55,429
Even if I did believe you,

1057
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:59,500
how in the world are you gonna
get anybody else to play along

1058
01:23:59,502 --> 01:24:01,502
and give up their data?

1059
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:04,038
We offer ours in return.

1060
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,439
Yeah?

1061
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,107
A trade?

1062
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:08,509
It's a non-zero-sum
game.

1063
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,781
Non-zero-sum game.

1064
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,750
That's it. Yeah.

1065
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:18,685
Thanks.

1066
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,061
Nine of
the landing sites have gone

1067
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:27,061
total comms blackout.

1068
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:30,364
Only way to reach them
is to physically
drive there

1069
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,733
and yell at the border guards,
which we're doing,

1070
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,234
but it won't be fast enough.

1071
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,603
There must be a way
to get the message
to them.

1072
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:39,606
To our allies, maybe,
but it's too little too late.

1073
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:42,342
<i>What we need is to get
all the other nations online</i>

1074
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:44,344
<i>before one starts global war.</i>

1075
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:46,346
<i>And there's no way
for us to reach them.</i>

1076
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,416
Okay, hold on a second.
There is!

1077
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,085
It's right above us.

1078
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,421
That's problematic
for us right now.

1079
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:57,558
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

1080
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,761
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

1081
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,629
Look, they're not our enemy.

1082
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:04,765
They've made no act of
aggression towards us.

1083
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:07,101
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

1084
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:08,535
That's not the question.

1085
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:10,270
What is the question?

1086
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,539
How do we get you
back in that room

1087
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,308
when it's half a mile
straight up?

1088
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,176
I think our work here is done.

1089
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,180
It's in the hands
of our superiors now.

1090
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,768
What the hell is she doing?

1091
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:37,624
Oh, my god! Oh, god, no!

1092
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,067
Costello...

1093
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:04,571
Where's abbott?

1094
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,702
I'm sorry.

1095
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:39,873
We're sorry.

1096
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:45,879
I need you to...

1097
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:50,150
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

1098
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:10,804
I don't...

1099
01:30:10,806 --> 01:30:12,906
I don't understand.

1100
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:17,010
What is your purpose here?

1101
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,939
How can you know the future?

1102
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:04,024
I don't...

1103
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:09,663
I don't understand.
Who is this child?

1104
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,536
<i>The show is called</i>

1105
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,972
<i>"mommy and daddy
talk to animals."</i>

1106
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,876
Wait! No! Wait!

1107
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,626
- Dr. banks!
- Louise!

1108
01:32:46,628 --> 01:32:48,228
Are you all right?

1109
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,233
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.

1110
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,834
What happened?

1111
01:32:54,836 --> 01:32:57,137
I'm trying to
figure it out.
This is too big.

1112
01:32:57,139 --> 01:32:59,806
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders
to evacuate.

1113
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:01,007
Why?

1114
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:03,143
Russia and Sudan
are following China.

1115
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,213
I don't understand.

1116
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:08,615
<i>Help me, mama.</i>

1117
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,118
Louise?
Whoa!

1118
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,219
Mom!

1119
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,691
Mama!

1120
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:22,028
Sorry, honey.

1121
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:27,167
What day is it?
Do you know, baby?

1122
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:29,002
Sunday.

1123
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:37,644
Are you gonna leave me
like daddy did?

1124
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:41,181
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't
leave you.

1125
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:43,283
You're gonna
see him this weekend.

1126
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,854
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

1127
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,797
It's my fault.

1128
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,936
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

1129
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:06,339
What?

1130
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,143
Well...

1131
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:12,646
Believe it or not,

1132
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:15,248
I know something
that's going to happen.

1133
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:20,053
I can't explain how I know.
I just do.

1134
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:24,958
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

1135
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,195
And he said I made
the wrong choice.

1136
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:34,901
What?
What's going to happen?

1137
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:41,775
It has to do with
a really rare disease.

1138
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:46,880
And it's unstoppable.

1139
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,984
Kind of like you are,

1140
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:54,754
with your swimming
and your poetry

1141
01:34:54,756 --> 01:34:56,322
and all the other amazing things

1142
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:58,191
that you share with the world.

1143
01:34:58,193 --> 01:34:59,893
I'm unstoppable?

1144
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:02,462
Yeah.

1145
01:35:18,847 --> 01:35:20,413
I got you.

1146
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:25,251
Louise? Louise?

1147
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,956
I just realized why
my husband left me.

1148
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,858
My husband left me.

1149
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,126
You were married?

1150
01:35:33,128 --> 01:35:36,062
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

1151
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:11,464
Mama?

1152
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:13,066
Yeah?

1153
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:15,769
Why's my name Hannah?

1154
01:36:17,472 --> 01:36:20,440
Get those people back, please.

1155
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:23,309
Well, your name is very special,

1156
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:25,912
because it is a palindrome.

1157
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:29,449
It reads the same forward
and backward.

1158
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:32,051
All right, guys,
give me a hand here.

1159
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:34,053
Yes, sir.
That goes in the bag.

1160
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:40,059
Ready to go!

1161
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,549
<i>Evacuation underway.</i>

1162
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,086
<i>Hey...</i>

1163
01:37:07,088 --> 01:37:11,157
We're done here!
We're taking this with us.

1164
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,116
I can read it.

1165
01:37:41,455 --> 01:37:43,456
I know what it is.
What?

1166
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:46,125
It's not a weapon.
It's a gift.

1167
01:37:46,127 --> 01:37:48,127
The weapon is their language.

1168
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:50,396
They gave it to us.
Do you know
what that means?

1169
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:53,533
So we can learn heptapod.
If we survive.

1170
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:56,336
If you learn it,
when you really learn it,

1171
01:37:56,338 --> 01:37:58,872
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do,

1172
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:02,008
so you can see what's to come.

1173
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:04,077
But time, it isn't
the same for them.

1174
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:06,346
It's non-linear.

1175
01:38:06,348 --> 01:38:09,082
Look, we did our best,
but it wasn't enough.

1176
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,018
The captain will load you up.

1177
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,386
You're lifting off in 5 minutes.

1178
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:17,557
Ian, Louise, it was
an honor to work with you.

1179
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:19,626
Good luck.

1180
01:38:23,264 --> 01:38:25,164
Hey, colonel...

1181
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:34,107
I'm gonna find out
where we're going.

1182
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:43,583
Wake up, mommy!

1183
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:21,020
Dr. banks...

1184
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:24,123
A pleasure.

1185
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:27,493
General shang,
the pleasure
is mine, really.

1186
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:29,629
Your president said

1187
01:39:29,631 --> 01:39:33,066
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

1188
01:39:33,068 --> 01:39:34,667
Yeah.

1189
01:39:34,669 --> 01:39:37,971
But I confess,
the only reason why I'm here

1190
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:41,541
is to meet you in person.

1191
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:46,079
Me? Well, I'm flattered.
Thank you.

1192
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:49,015
18 months ago,

1193
01:39:49,017 --> 01:39:51,551
you did something remarkable,

1194
01:39:51,553 --> 01:39:55,621
something not even
my superior has done.

1195
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:58,658
And what's that?

1196
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,460
You changed my mind.

1197
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:06,733
You're the reason
for this unification,

1198
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:11,270
all because you
reached out to me
at my private number.

1199
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:15,475
Your private number?

1200
01:40:15,477 --> 01:40:18,044
General, I... I don't know
your private number.

1201
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:25,785
Now you know.

1202
01:40:27,321 --> 01:40:30,590
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

1203
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:35,428
but I believe it was
important for you
to see that.

1204
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,065
I called you, didn't I?

1205
01:40:40,134 --> 01:40:42,468
Yes, you did.

1206
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:54,814
Louise!

1207
01:41:11,131 --> 01:41:14,200
All right,
let's shut down the system.

1208
01:41:14,202 --> 01:41:17,603
Sir? There's a sat line
here dialing China.

1209
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,474
Here? What do
you mean "here"?

1210
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:26,245
Come on, come on!

1211
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,114
Whose phone is it?

1212
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:33,586
It's your phone, sir.

1213
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,428
Search base camp now.

1214
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,697
Find out who's using that phone.

1215
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:46,532
And hold on to
those coordinates.

1216
01:41:46,534 --> 01:41:47,700
Yes, sir.

1217
01:41:47,702 --> 01:41:50,169
Come on... what do I say?

1218
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,672
What do I say?

1219
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,184
Come on.

1220
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:08,721
I will never forget
what you said.

1221
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:23,236
You told me
my wife's dying words.

1222
01:42:39,786 --> 01:42:41,654
We found the source
of the phone call.

1223
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,776
It's in the clean room.
We're waiting
for instructions.

1224
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:48,728
What are you doing?

1225
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:50,863
What are you doing?
Changing someone's mind.

1226
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:52,865
Can you buy me 20 seconds?
We don't have time for this.

1227
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:54,467
No, trust me.
Buy me 20 seconds.

1228
01:42:54,469 --> 01:42:56,569
Do you trust me?
Okay. Yeah.

1229
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:03,476
Dr. banks, drop the phone
now or we shoot!

1230
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,880
Drop it!

1231
01:43:07,882 --> 01:43:09,248
I'm sorry!

1232
01:43:10,718 --> 01:43:13,653
You are committing
an act of treason!

1233
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,760
Yes.
Drop it!

1234
01:43:20,762 --> 01:43:22,528
It's done. I'm done.

1235
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,680

01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,548
Daddy!

1271
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,125
You okay?

1272
01:47:50,664 --> 01:47:52,531
Are you ready?

1273
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:57,703
Oh, guess what? Star stuff!

1274
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:01,574
Ian?

1275
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:01,574
Yeah?

1276
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:06,545
If you could see your whole
life from start to finish,

1277
01:48:08,615 --> 01:48:10,716
would you change things?

1278
01:48:16,756 --> 01:48:20,826
Maybe I'd say
what I feel more often.

1279
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:22,561
I... I don't know.

1280
01:48:37,978 --> 01:48:40,679
You know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

1281
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:42,248
for as long as i can remember.

1282
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:47,253
You know what
surprised me the most?

1283
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:51,190
It wasn't meeting them.

1284
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:58,197
It was meeting you.

1285
01:49:38,104 --> 01:49:42,041
I forgot how good it felt
to be held by you.

1286
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:53,085
You wanna make a baby?

1287
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:30,022
Yes. Yeah.
