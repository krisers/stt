﻿1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,287
Attention, squad.

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:06,756
Mm, pretty dainty way
to make an announcement.

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,657
It's a workplace.
I wanted to be respectful.

4
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:09,926
Well, as someone
at a high risk

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,728
for a spook-related death,
thank you.

6
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:14,197
As I was saying,
it's time for round four

7
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,664
of the Halloween Heist...

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,770
If I don't make it,
tell Gina I love her.

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,338
What's up, Nine-Nine?

10
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,907
Jake Peralta here to tell you

11
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:26,909
that tonight is the night
for the Halloween...

12
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:27,944
Heist.

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,045
Amy already went over this.

14
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,580
What?
Ames, what are you doing?

15
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,701
I always announce the heist.

16
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:33,582
Yeah, Amy, what the hell
are you doing?

17
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,551
Exercising my right
to announce the heist

18
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:36,852
as the defending champion.

19
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:37,887
Defending champion.

20
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,122
The only reason you won
is 'cause

21
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,390
no one knew
you were even playing.

22
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,525
It was a pathetic act
of pure cowardice.

23
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,526
Whoa, she's your girlfriend,
Peralta.

24
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:45,661
Not tonight, she isn't.

25
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:47,030
Although don't kiss
anyone else.

26
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,031
I love you so much.

27
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:49,599
Now, then, this one's for all...

28
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,610
- Such a dork.
- So cool.

29
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,744
Attention, squad.

30
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,079
- Tonight...
- Nope.

31
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,215
Y'all three really
should have coordinated.

32
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:07,550
What? I really should be
the one to introduce the heist,

33
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,719
as the last
legitimate champion.

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,354
Peralta hasn't won
since the first year.

35
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:12,789
He's a has-been.

36
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,225
Yeah, well, this has-been
has been with yo' mama all week.

37
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,427
Sorry, I feel like I crossed
a line; I apologize.

38
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,696
Attention, everyone.

39
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,631
Enough. We know.
The heist is happening.

40
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,666
No!

41
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,201
My ex-wife just died.

42
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:27,302
No more alimony, baby!

43
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:31,016

44
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,460
This year's Halloween Heist
is a three-way tiebreaker

45
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,127
to determine
the champion of champions.

46
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,631
We'll be playing for this:
a plaque that reads,

47
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,833
"The Ultimate
Detective/Genius."

48
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,635
You and Santiago
should quit now.

49
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:00,435
I'm going to stomp
on your dreams.

50
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,105
It's fun to see you
so passionate.

51
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,073
I will slit you both open
from mouth to anus

52
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:05,474
and wear you like jackets.

53
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,743
Wow. Is it weird that
that turned me on a little bit?

54
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:08,977
Doesn't matter.

55
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,079
But let's move on.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,814
The plaque will be held
in this.

57
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,050
Is that my childhood caboodle?

58
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,584
It most certainly is,
but don't worry.

59
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,587
I removed the scrunchies,
old report cards,

60
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,155
and photos of young Al Gore.

61
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:20,822
I'm better-looking
than him anyway.

62
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,926
We're talking a young Al Gore?

63
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,161
Peralta, you do make me laugh.

64
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:27,596
Okay, stings a little bit.

65
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:29,599
It will be secured
with this brand-new lock.

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,669
Hitchcock, if you would do
the honors.

67
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,904
There you are.

68
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:35,972
You can have that back
in three...

69
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:37,372
Nope, don't ever need it back.

70
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,108
Now, then, locking the caboodle.

71
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:42,278
The "ca-boo-dale"
will be placed

72
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,812
in the center of the bullpen.

73
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,381
Right, and what is the name
of the store at the mall

74
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,382
that sells the sticky pastries?

75
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:47,683
You mean the "See-nay-bone"?

76
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,118
Yeah, that was it. Thanks.
Continue.

77
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:52,355
Whoever possesses the plaque
at sunup wins.

78
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:54,389
Now let's pick teams.

79
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,491
I've got a ton of work.

80
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,760
You can just leave me out
this year.

81
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,995
- Interesting. Interesting.
- Oh, Terry, Terry, Terry.

82
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,029
What?

83
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,531
How naive do you think we are?

84
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,467
You're "not participating"
so you can

85
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,436
sneak under our noses
and steal a victory,

86
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,204
like Santiago did last year.

87
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,372
I'm going to my desk.

88
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:10,607
Heists are dumb.

89
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:11,808
If you have nothing to hide,

90
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,142
then I'm sure
you won't mind me asking

91
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,077
Hitchcock and Scully
to keep an eye on you.

92
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,112
Whatever.

93
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,046
My eyes will be glued
to that ass.

94
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:20,783
Great! It's now time to choose
from the remaining players.

95
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,086
Amy, since you're last year's
champion, you go first.

96
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,921
- I choose Rosa.
- Dope.

97
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:26,588
I select Charles Boyle.

98
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,624
What?

99
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,025
What's the matter, Peralta?

100
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,628
Were you expecting to have
Detective Boyle on your team?

101
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,796
Have I thrown a wrench
into your plans?

102
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,897
Absolutely not.

103
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,065
I'm just surprised,
because you have

104
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,426
such a strong connection
with Gina.

105
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,434
But I'm glad she's on my team.

106
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,703
I had absolutely nothing
planned for Charles.

107
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,373
I totally planned everything
for Charles.

108
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,874
- This is a nightmare!
- Ew!

109
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,043
What can Charles Boyle do
that I can't?

110
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,176
Roller-skate like an angel.

111
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:50,013
Whore, I'm great on skates.

112
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,614
Or are you forgetting
Jenn Sutton's

113
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:52,848
fourth grade birthday party?

114
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:54,550
I have definitely
forgotten that.

115
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,453
Well, I skated like a pro,
and then I spent

116
00:03:57,454 --> 00:04:00,522
seven minutes in heaven
with the Todd Cohen.

117
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:01,591
It was dope.

118
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,959
My point is,
I can do anything Charles can.

119
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,396
Except look exactly like
the body double I got for him.

120
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:08,297
Bill, you can come out now.

121
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,300
Hi.

122
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,169
Okay, yeah,
this pasty white guy

123
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,736
is gonna be a problem.

124
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:17,106
So I believe the key
to good teamwork

125
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,708
is an equal exchange
of ideas...

126
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,810
Stop.
I know you already have a plan.

127
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:22,979
And I want to win,
so for the next eight hours,

128
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,946
I'm down with all
your nerdy crap.

129
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,048
Come on, Amy.

130
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,482
Show me the binder.

131
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,786
Okay, but it's not a binder.

132
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:31,454
It's a virtual binder,

133
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,289
and it's encrypted
on this flash drive.

134
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,456
That's my girl.

135
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,758
Now, where's the 3-D model
of the precinct?

136
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,194
Inside the key chain.

137
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,961
It's a frickin' hologram.

138
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:41,330
Yes.

139
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,631
I'm so excited, Captain.

140
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,100
So... how are we gonna do it?

141
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,002
Here's everything
you need to know.

142
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,609
- It's blank.
- It's a metaphor.

143
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:56,045
You get nothing.
You lose.

144
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,279
Good day, sir.

145
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:58,414
But we're teammates.

146
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,449
You chose me.

147
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,717
You're too close
with Peralta.

148
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:01,750
I don't trust you.

149
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,453
I only chose you
to disrupt his plans.

150
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:05,988
And now that you've served
your purpose,

151
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,155
you're no longer needed.

152
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:09,758
I feel so used.

153
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,360
Am I just a piece
of meat to you?

154
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,395
Yes.

155
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,496
Now, put on a smile, Pork Chop.

156
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:17,933
So what are you planning
for the heist?

157
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,670
The only thing I'm planning
is getting my work done.

158
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,670
Sure, you are.

159
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:22,905
Come clean,

160
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,639
or we'll tell everybody
about your mistress.

161
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,041
I don't have a mistress.

162
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,076
You don't?

163
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,378
But you're so good-looking.

164
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,444
What's the point?

165
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,049
As expected, all eyes
are on the caboodle.

166
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,784
It's go time.
Now, Gina.

167
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,887
Whoopsie!

168
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:39,389
Bill, but you got
to stand like me.

169
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,124
I'm kind of like
a young Brando,

170
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,426
so give it that energy.

171
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,693
Okay, yeah.

172
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:45,762
You're doing the best you can

173
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,763
with the tools that you have.

174
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,797
Looks like nobody's onto us.

175
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:48,798
Go, Gina!

176
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,201
So, Bill,
do you have a real job or...

177
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:54,937
I'm the third
in a lot of marriages.

178
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,305
I got a nice soft face,

179
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:57,739
so I don't intimidate
the husbands.

180
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,609
Hmm, strange,
the random person I hired

181
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,110
off the streets of Brooklyn
is a weirdo.

182
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,445
- What?
- Hmm? Nothing.

183
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,445
There she goes.

184
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,383
Now, Bill, the key here
is that I came in before work

185
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:08,484
and replaced the door handles

186
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,686
with ones that lock
from the outside.

187
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,554
Pretty smart.

188
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,690
All right, Bill.
The time is now.

189
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:16,859
Show your face.

190
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,760
Show your face to the world!

191
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:22,502
What the hell? Amy!

192
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,935
Pick your jaws up
off the floor, ladies.

193
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,171
Where did Gina come from?

194
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:32,340
And here comes Jake!
Whoo!

195
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:36,511
Welcome to the big show.

196
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:39,081
I was gonna sneak the plaque out
without anybody knowing,

197
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,081
but then I thought...

198
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,217
so much more fun
to make you watch.

199
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,585
Now enjoy

200
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,421
as I steal
the plaque of destiny.

201
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,793
Ah, trying to pick the lock,
<i>El Capitán?</i>

202
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,261
That'll take
at least three minutes,

203
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,297
by which time I will have
hidden this plaque

204
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,899
somewhere you will never
find it.

205
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,471
Voilà.

206
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,371
Of course, you could break
the window,

207
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,567
but you would never knowingly

208
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,809
destroy government property,
would you?

209
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,543
Whoop!
Well, misread that one.

210
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,012
Gina, skate!
Skate like the wind!

211
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,784
- Aah!
- So long, suckers!

212
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,721
Oh! Gina, are you okay?

213
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,190
It's cool.

214
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,225
I'm fine.

215
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:23,291
Ain't no thang.

216
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:26,761
Totally, girl!
You look good!

217
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,732
Oh, it hurts so bad.

218
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,200
I hope to God
I'm not humbled by this.

219
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,335
I'm so sorry, Gina.

220
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,171
It should have been Charles
on those skates.

221
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,939
This is why you should
always roller-skate

222
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,574
with a helmet
and a mouth guard.

223
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:39,942
Hey, don't blame the victim.

224
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:40,943
I'm just so sick

225
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,812
of roller skating's
dangerous image.

226
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,380
We're not all bad boys.

227
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,381
Yeah, none.

228
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,482
All right, Gina,
get your stuff.

229
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:47,483
I'm taking you to the dentist.

230
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:48,484
No, no, no, no.

231
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,585
I'll go alone.

232
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,387
I don't need anyone's help.

233
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,589
Just order me an UberSELECT
or better.

234
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,025
And despite our natural desire
to stop everything,

235
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,661
you'd like us
to soldier on in your absence

236
00:07:58,662 --> 00:07:59,694
and keep the heist going?

237
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,096
Yeah, that's fine.

238
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,632
Well, you heard the lady.
She insists we continue.

239
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,700
Let's mop up this blood
and get back at it.

240
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,868
With all due respect, sir,

241
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,703
I don't think
that's the best idea.

242
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,705
The blood is dry.
We can just clean it up after.

243
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:10,872
Oh, agreed.

244
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,075
Ah, I love tonight.

245
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,778
However, there is the small
issue of me losing my partner.

246
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,381
Now, Terry,
I know that you were upset

247
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,615
that no one picked you earlier.

248
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:20,683
Not what happened.

249
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:21,951
Regardless,
please be my partner,

250
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,019
please, please, please,
please, please, please.

251
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,053
No! Heists are dumb,
and I have work to do.

252
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,291
You're dumb,
and I have... heist to do.

253
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,091
Overreacted. Damn it!

254
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,627
You know what?
Forget Terry.

255
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:32,862
At the time of the accident,

256
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,930
my team had the plaque,
so I will just grab it

257
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,532
and give myself
a four-minute head start.

258
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,799
Not so fast, Peralta.

259
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:40,569
I say we reset the plaque
and start over.

260
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,038
What?
But my team had it.

261
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,038
Charles, tell him.

262
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:46,909
No, Jake.

263
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,444
We're resetting.

264
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,812
Charles, what are you saying?

265
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,180
The plaque...

266
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,548
goes...

267
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:55,718
Back!

268
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:00,355
Yes, Pork Chop.
Yes.

269
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,060
I have eyes on Kristy,
Stacey, and Claudia.

270
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,360
You used their code names.

271
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,596
You read the plans,
addenda and all!

272
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,664
Damn right, I did.
I told you, I'm all in.

273
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,300
And you didn't make fun of me
for basing it all

274
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,601
on "The Baby-Sitters Club."

275
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,970
And I even did
your suggested reading

276
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,036
of "Kristy's Big Day."

277
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,305
You did?

278
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,673
Calm down.

279
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:18,673
You're such a Mary Anne.

280
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,376
I am! It's true!

281
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,776
So, Boyle, I was impressed

282
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,213
with how you stood up to Peralta
and demanded a reset.

283
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,848
Ha!
I'm Team Holt all the way, baby.

284
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,184
Also, I'm pretty upset
with him

285
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:30,118
for letting Gina
sweat up my skates.

286
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,855
Well, perhaps I can
use a teammate after all.

287
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,489
Do you swear I can trust you?

288
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:35,958
Yes.

289
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,459
I swear.

290
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:43,064
Let's unleash hell.

291
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,500
Thanks for coming back, Bill.

292
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,135
I really needed a teammate.

293
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,669
Hey, man, you're paying.

294
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:48,771
Yeah.

295
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,739
You can take the wig off
if you want.

296
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,675
Whatever you want, man.
You're paying.

297
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,876
Could you stop
saying that, Bill?

298
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:55,011
It's making me
a little uncomfortable.

299
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,412
All right, man.
It's your money.

300
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:57,812
That's the same thing.

301
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,115
What is this?

302
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:00,649
It's a jack-o'-lantern.
Don't touch it.

303
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,685
Why not? Because you're
hiding something in there?

304
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,786
Because my daughters made it

305
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,321
and your palms are all black.

306
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:06,789
What have you been touching?

307
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,190
Huh!
Well, this has got me stumped.

308
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:11,093
I got a pizza here
for Raymond Holt.

309
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,462
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

310
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:14,830
Holt hates pizza.

311
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,332
He's trying to distract us.

312
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,633
Oh, if I were trying
to distract you,

313
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:18,935
I would have sent you the pizza.

314
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,169
This is your doing,
you and your male prostitute.

315
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,139
Bill is not
a male prostitute,

316
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,172
I don't think.

317
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,740
I have a pizza here
for Raymond Holt.

318
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,008
What's going on?

319
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,311
I have a pizza here
for Raymond Holt.

320
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:29,845
Which one of you bozos
did this?

321
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:30,879
Us?

322
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,148
You know how much
planning it takes

323
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,516
to get this many pizza guys here
at the same time?

324
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,783
A binder full of planning.

325
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:36,719
This has Amy written
all over it.

326
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,487
If I had done this, it would
say "Captain Raymond Holt."

327
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:40,957
I'm not going
to disrespect you, sir,

328
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,258
even for the sake of the heist.

329
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,525
I'll guard the plaque!

330
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,893
You're not leaving my sight.

331
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,095
Bill, can you see
what's going on?

332
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,629
Do you have eyes
on Charles and Rosa?

333
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:48,797
I don't know who anybody is.

334
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,065
There's too much pizza!

335
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,801
I see Holt. I see Charles.
Where's Terry?

336
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:54,203
Terry's leaving,
because Terry's got work to do.

337
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,571
Hitchcock! Scully!

338
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,273
- Follow Terry!
- On it!

339
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:00,075
Aah! I'm getting
bounced around like a pinball!

340
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,810
- This is madness!
- Who hired you?

341
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,145
Who do you work for,
pizza man?

342
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:08,283
Everyone with a pizza,
get out of here!

343
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,556
- The caboodle!
- The caboodle!

344
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,857
The "ca-boo-dale"!

345
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,516
I know one of you
took the plaque.

346
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:21,777
And I swear on my living
mother's future grave,

347
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,211
I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

348
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:26,046
Or it was you, Jake.
You love pizza.

349
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:27,098
It's true.

350
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:28,683
You had it for breakfast
this morning.

351
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:31,219
When pizza's on a bagel,
you can eat pizza anytime!

352
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
Well, it certainly wasn't
Boyle and me.

353
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:34,589
We were out here
the whole time.

354
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,689
Plus, we already ate.

355
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,726
Autumn salads
with farm-fresh squash.

356
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,928
That's right,
I'm catering for our team.

357
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,097
Look who I found hiding
in the interrogation room:

358
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,598
this guilty son of a bitch.

359
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,765
Still your sergeant.

360
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,735
Look, I wasn't hiding.
I was doing my work.

361
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:48,103
Hitchcock and Scully
were with me.

362
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:50,071
Were they,
or perhaps were they distracted

363
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,340
by your brilliant pizza ruse?

364
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:54,810
Totally distracted.
I ate two whole pies.

365
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:56,210
Folded 'em up like tacos.

366
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:58,046
You're suspect number one,
Jeffords.

367
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,048
- Whatever.
- "Whatever."

368
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,749
Spoken like a common criminal.

369
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:03,518
Still a long time till sunup.

370
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,886
All I have to say is,

371
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:06,788
whoever took that plaque,

372
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:08,723
you better watch out.

373
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:09,958
Come on, Rosa.

374
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,595
- Come on, Boyle.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,499
Come on...

376
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,133
Bill.

377
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:22,837
Okay, was the operation
a success?

378
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,907
You tell me.

379
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,908
<i>Blended right in
with the pizza guys.</i>

380
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:29,845
<i>Got out my bolt cutters.</i>

381
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,445
<i>Lock snapped on the first try.</i>

382
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,479
<i>No one saw me leave.</i>

383
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,481
<i>Got to hand it to you...</i>

384
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:34,482
beautiful plan.

385
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,917
Beautiful execution.

386
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,419
It's kind of like we're
our own baby-sitters club.

387
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,121
Oh, my God, I don't want
tonight to ever end.

388
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:41,523
Did you by chance
read the excerpt

389
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:42,990
from "The Truth About Stacey"?

390
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,359
The one about
the rival baby-sitters...

391
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,760
That get caught
smoking cigarettes?

392
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:48,396
Well, let's just say
that these two baby-sitters

393
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:51,433
aren't getting caught
with squat.

394
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,134
This is where I stash
a few cigarettes

395
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:55,169
on the rare occasion
that I need a puff.

396
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,174
Dope.

397
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,142
The hiding place,
not the smoking.

398
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:02,911
Mary Anne is better than that.

399
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,812
She's a work in progress.

400
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,182
This is so frustrating.

401
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:10,351
There's no way of knowing
who has the plaque.

402
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,153
- Amy and Rosa have it.
- What? How do you know?

403
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,555
Diaz usually favors
her left leg,

404
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:14,890
but after "zero dark pizza,"

405
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:16,358
she was suddenly
favoring her right.

406
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,961
Yes, yes,
which means that she...

407
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:21,462
was...

408
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,400
You trailed off
and didn't finish speaking.

409
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:27,335
Continue.

410
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:28,470
I don't want to.

411
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:29,537
Her gait was thrown off

412
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:31,205
because she was carrying
the plaque.

413
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,008
And I know exactly
where it's hidden:

414
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,010
in Santiago's
secret cigarette stash.

415
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:37,279
How did you find that?

416
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,213
Whenever she gets
stressed out, she smokes.

417
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,449
And it's almost too easy
to stress her out.

418
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,619
Oh, Santiago, I...

419
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,354
Never mind.

420
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:47,589
What is it?

421
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,657
What?

422
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:49,690
I got to go.

423
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,330
Bing-pot.

424
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,132
And now it's time to send in

425
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,034
our cute little secret weapon.

426
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:00,201
I'm ready, Captain.

427
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:01,269
I love the nickname.

428
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,570
No, Charles, not you.

429
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:03,804
I was talking about Cheddar.

430
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,540
Oh, right, obviously.

431
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,042
Over the past month,
I've had him trained

432
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:08,376
to retrieve plaques.

433
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:09,444
And now, boy,

434
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,179
it's time to make Daddy proud.

435
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,179
Yes, sir.

436
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,615
I could not have been
more clearly

437
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,016
talking to the dog.

438
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,126
Time is running out.

439
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,594
We got to stop
playing by the rules

440
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:27,796
and start playing dirty.

441
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:28,863
Follow my lead, Bill.

442
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:30,398
Okay, but first
I should tell you

443
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,033
my safe word is "cabbage."

444
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:33,034
Why?

445
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,035
You know what?
Never mind.

446
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:35,337
It doesn't matter.
Hey, Charles!

447
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:36,638
Charles, get in here.

448
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,706
Come on.

449
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:38,807
What is Holt up to?

450
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:40,608
Does he have the plaque?
Does he know who does?

451
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,776
I'm not telling you
that, Jake.

452
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:42,978
I'm Team Holt,
and there's nothing

453
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:44,045
you could say
that will change that.

454
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,313
Okay, fine,
then I guess I have

455
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:47,381
a new best friend,
and his name...

456
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,415
is Bill.

457
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,151
You're not serious.

458
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,586
He's just a prop
for the heist.

459
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,555
Sure, it started out
that way,

460
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,790
but you know
how these things go,

461
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,392
spending time together,

462
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,227
sharing intimate secrets,

463
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:01,129
laughing about nothing
in particular.

464
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,396
Cabbage.

465
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:03,565
Holt has the plaque.

466
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,833
It's hidden
in the evidence room

467
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,468
in a box marked
"Cold Cases 1972."

468
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:08,602
Thanks, bud.
We will always be best friends.

469
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:11,806
You hear that, Bill?

470
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,273
Nobody likes you!

471
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,912
Ain't she a beaut?

472
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:18,913
Sexy.

473
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,148
Immediately ruined it, Bill.

474
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,148
Immediately.

475
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:23,385
Here you go.

476
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:26,787
Chht, chht, chht, chh...

477
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:27,988
What is happening right now?

478
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:30,191
The last sands are running
through the hourglass...

479
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:31,192
chh, chh, chh...

480
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,028
because your time
is running out,

481
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,996
and you are never
going to get the plaque.

482
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,598
Oh, Captain, stop.

483
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,298
I just can't let you
embarrass yourself.

484
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,934
I told Jake everything.

485
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,101
He threatened to replace me,

486
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,405
and I freaked out hard.

487
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:45,006
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

488
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:46,708
I knew you would betray me.

489
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,609
That's why I fed you fake Intel.

490
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:49,711
What?

491
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:52,614
The plaque was never
in "Cold Cases 1972."

492
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:54,949
As if I'd just put it
in a box, unattended.

493
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,617
Uh, but you did.

494
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:57,652
No, I didn't.

495
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:59,987
Then how do you explain this?

496
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:01,990
I have no idea.

497
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,151
I put the plaque
in my office.

498
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,859
Cheddar?

499
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,327
Come here. Come here.
Come here, baby.

500
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:08,196
- What the hell?
- Yeah, thank you.

501
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:09,530
Return to my office, please.

502
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,266
What's up, you little turds?

503
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,367
Wait, what is going on?
We have the plaque.

504
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:14,835
Yeah, I just got it
out of the vent

505
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,237
to rub it in your faces.

506
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,639
"I Just Got It Out of the Vent
to Rub It in Your Faces."

507
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,140
Name of your sex tape.
What?

508
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:21,810
Something strange is afoot.

509
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,211
Which of these is real?

510
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,646
Black lights.
What the hell?

511
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,415
Oh, my God.
Our precinct is disgusting.

512
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,583
Dear God.

513
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:30,452
Hitchcock and Scully's desk.

514
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:31,820
- Ugh!
- Wait.

515
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:32,821
Look at the plaques.

516
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:34,054
- "Are."
- "Heists."

517
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,123
"Dumb."

518
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,890
Are heists dumb?
Of course not.

519
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,193
That was a stupid question.

520
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,895
No, Jake, it's says,
"Heists are dumb."

521
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,081
Terry!

522
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:46,946
The Oscar for best liar
goes to you!

523
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:48,648
That's not an Oscars category.

524
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:49,716
What's going on?

525
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,283
Not to be harsh, Sarge,

526
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:52,919
but you're setting
a terrible example

527
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,387
for your daughters,
and they're gonna grow up

528
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,754
to be total failures.

529
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,224
You take that back.

530
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,359
No, she's right, Jeffords.
Your children are doomed.

531
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,426
Where's the plaque?

532
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:02,696
For the last time,
I don't know.

533
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:04,730
I've been working here
the whole time.

534
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:05,765
Ask them.

535
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,901
Well, actually,
we both fell asleep.

536
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,836
And Jeffords
never woke us up.

537
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:11,338
Coincidence?

538
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,605
I don't need this.

539
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,406
You're not going anywhere.

540
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,774
Damn, Rosa!

541
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,910
He's trying to get away!

542
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,010
Everyone start panicking!

543
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,278
He had someone lock the door.

544
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:22,782
'Sup, losers?

545
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:25,818
I have the real plaque!
Unh, unh!

546
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:27,720
Gina! Of course!

547
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,955
It all makes sense,

548
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,523
except for the parts
I don't understand

549
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,425
and the fact that I still
kind of think Terry did this.

550
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,627
Nope, it was all me.

551
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:37,097
Three weeks ago,
Captain Holt asked me

552
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,797
to order a plaque that read,

553
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,068
<i>"The Ultimate
Detective/Genius."</i>

554
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,504
I did it,
and I ordered three copies

555
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,273
and a statue of Tyrese
riding a dolphin.

556
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:49,608
- Is that relevant?
- To my life, yes.

557
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,612
Once I had the plaques,
I manipulated Captain Holt

558
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,382
into choosing Boyle
as his partner.

559
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:58,451
All it took was
six bottles of dish soap.

560
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,653
See, this is what happens

561
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,654
when Jake tries to wash dishes
by himself.

562
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,889
It's like he's helpless
without Boyle.

563
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:06,059
Yes.

564
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,595
He is helpless without Boyle.

565
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,297
And you fell for my trap

566
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,331
like a greedy little rat.

567
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,365
Easy.

568
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,167
Yes, it was easy.

569
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:17,537
And the next phase of my plan:

570
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:20,106
<i>a "skating accident."</i>

571
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:22,174
But you knocked out
your two front teeth.

572
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,743
False teeth.

573
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,378
<i>Fake blood.</i>

574
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,681
I lost my real teeth
at Jenn Sutton's

575
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:30,282
birthday party
in fourth grade.

576
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,419
Oh, you made sure
I didn't remember that!

577
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,586
It was minute five

578
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:35,522
of seven minutes in heaven
with Todd Cohen

579
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:36,623
when he bumped the wall

580
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,190
and a bowling ball fell
on my face.

581
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,160
Maybe I just
wasn't at that party.

582
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,861
<i>Once I had faked
the skating mishap,</i>

583
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:44,997
<i>I swapped out a dummy plaque
for the real one.</i>

584
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:46,833
<i>Then I left
to go to the dentist.</i>

585
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,034
And you convinced your dentist

586
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,569
to help you carry out
the rest of the heist.

587
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,204
- No.
- Of course not. Go ahead.

588
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,973
I came back,
wearing the perfect disguise

589
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:55,575
to make sure I was never noticed
by anyone.

590
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:58,344
Something so drab
and uninspiring...

591
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,112
This feels like
it's gonna be a dig on me.

592
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:02,015
- I wore Amy's clothes.
- There it is.

593
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,150
This is your doing,
you and your male prostitute.

594
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:06,920
Bill is not a male prostitute,
I don't think.

595
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,054
That suit is not drab.

596
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,723
It has a fun salmon lining.

597
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:11,657
No, Amy, it made me invisible.

598
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,493
And now
that I had that power,

599
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:15,294
<i>every time one of you
stole a plaque,</i>

600
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,997
<i>I replaced it with a fake.</i>

601
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:18,897
And no one had any idea

602
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,200
<i>until the lights went out,</i>

603
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,667
<i>revealing a secret message:</i>

604
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,236
<i>"Heists are dumb."</i>

605
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,970
Then we raced in here
to blame Terry,

606
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:26,272
and you trapped us.

607
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:28,474
But how did you know he was
gonna say "heists are dumb"?

608
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:29,842
Terry says
that about everything.

609
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,243
Everyone should wear
suspenders.

610
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:32,278
Belts are dumb.

611
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,584
People should swim forward.

612
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:34,614
The backstroke is dumb.

613
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,215
30 grams of fat?

614
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,349
Hummus is dumb.

615
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,719
And now here you all are,

616
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,488
locked up behind the glass

617
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,756
like a bunch of loser fish.

618
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,959
I bet you're wondering
why I did it.

619
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,027
Because you wanted to win?

620
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:49,428
No!
I had a loftier goal in mind.

621
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:50,764
Can you do me a favor
and tell me

622
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,930
what that says right there?

623
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,866
"The Ultimate
Detective/Genius."

624
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,135
Detective.

625
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:57,003
Can you imagine
what that word sounds like

626
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,705
to someone
who's not a detective?

627
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:00,072
Discriminatory.

628
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,674
It's worse than segregation.

629
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,610
Uh-uh.
- Too far? I'm sorry.

630
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,445
But I think
I've proved a point,

631
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,882
and that's why we're changing
the name of the plaque forever!

632
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,917
To what?

633
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,951
Gina Linetti

634
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:15,287
is the ultimate human/genius.

635
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,389
Thank you.

636
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,124
And now I'd like to say
a few words.

637
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,292
You talked for, like, an hour

638
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,560
when you had us locked
in that interrogation room.

639
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:21,594
I'm a fair ruler.

640
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,128
Your comment has been heard.

641
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:24,464
But seriously, you guys,

642
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:25,732
I just want to say,

643
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,734
I freaking love you losers.

644
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,401
Happy Halloween.

645
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,671
Happy Halloween!

646
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:32,772
Take out your teeth.

647
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,773
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

648
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,140
Take out your teeth!

649
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:36,576
