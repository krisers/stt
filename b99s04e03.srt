<i>"Power News Live at Five."</i>

3
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:05,733
<i>We've got the most
high school sports,</i>

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:07,101
<i>the most lottery numbers,</i>

<i>It's news time!</i>

8
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:14,108
Good evening,
I'm Brynn DeRose.

9
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,209
And I'm Slade Austin.

10
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,310
Tonight on "Power News,"

11
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:17,745
we reveal who Donald Trump

12
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:19,380
is running against
for President.

13
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,149
Plus, we'll show you
the winning lottery numbers.

14
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,652
Could 67 be one of them?

15
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,620
Two prisoners have escaped

16
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:28,188
from the Coral Palms
sheriff's station

17
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,224
in a daring daylight jailbreak.

18
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,092
<i>The men, identified
as Gregory Stickney</i>

19
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,327
<i>and Larry Sherbert</i>

20
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,995
<i>were arrested after
a routine traffic stop</i>

21
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,298
revealed a cache
of automatic weapons.

22
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,533
Less than 12 hours later,
the men escaped

23
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,069
by creating a disturbance
in their cell.

24
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,270
Well, they started kissing,

25
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,438
which I'm fine with...

26
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,174
really, I am,
kiss whoever you want...

27
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:48,943
except they were both men.

28
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:51,612
Tito Amendola was also
in holding at the time

29
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:53,047
and witnessed the jailbreak.

30
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:56,250
I do a lot of meth.

31
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,786
The sheriff's office is
coordinating their search

32
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:00,854
with local and state police.

33
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,323
If you're watching,
Greg and Larry,

34
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,390
and I know you are,

35
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,992
my men and I will not rest

36
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:06,660
until we find you.

37
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,695
That's right,

38
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,163
we're coming for you.

39
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,298
Strong words, and moving on,

40
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,867
what if you were going
through a drive-thru,

41
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,657
and a puppy dog
took your order?

43
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:43,831
The cops are looking for us,

44
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:45,065
and a madman wants us dead.

45
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,534
We should be laying low
until the Nine-Nine gets here.

46
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:49,336
Yeah, but we don't know
when that's gonna be,

47
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:50,771
and we need food and supplies.

48
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,806
Okay, I'll get some water.

49
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:55,576
Holt, are you trying
to draw attention to us?

50
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:57,111
Nobody drinks water here.

51
00:01:57,112 --> 00:01:58,679
Choose something blue or green.

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,547
Okay, I guess
I'll go in for, uh,

53
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:03,650
the Blazing Blue Rad-berry
Cooler Xtreme: Code Rad.

54
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:04,752
Good choice.

55
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:07,021
I should probably get
some body spray as well.

56
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:09,423
What sounds better,
Liquid Moan or Turnpike?

57
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:11,091
We only have $17 to our name.

58
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,526
We can't spend five
of it on this.

59
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,128
I know, but I'm about to see
Amy for the first time

60
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,729
in forever, and I want
to smell like a...

61
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,165
"hot New Jersey breeze," ugh.

62
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,265
Good call.

63
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,602
All right, let's get
out of here.

64
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,536
<i>And in Coral Palms,
law enforcement</i>

65
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,439
<i>still is searching
for a pair of fugitives</i>

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,741
<i>who broke out of jail
earlier this evening.</i>

67

<i>Greg Stickney

68

<i>are believed to be
unarmed but dangerous.</i>

69
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,613
Liquid Moan, nice.

70
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:35,015
I wore this to Swampsgiving
last year... cleaned up.

71
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,183
Right on, bro.

72
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,085
Oh, we have a promotion
on the Code Rad.

73
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,386
- It comes with a free cigarette.
- Oh, no.

74
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:40,721
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.

75
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:41,855
Well, if you don't want it,
I'll take it.

76
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:43,290
No, no, no.
Don't do that... smoking is bad.

77
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,291
You should quit smoking
right now.

78
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,492
Hey...

79
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:56,970
Ahh.

80
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,439
We seem to be in the clear.

81
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,706
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah.

82
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,275
I got caught on top
of the fence.

83
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:03,510
Check out my calf...
it's like Scratch City.

84
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:04,745
How about you?

85
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:07,581
I'm fine, except I was impaled
on a metal pipe.

86
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,917
Oh, my God!

87
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,647
Oh, my God!

88
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,124
It's gonna be fine.

89
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,826
Oh, my God!

90
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,961
I got rifles, vests,
flash grenades...

91
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:23,997
Chips, dips,
ice cream sammies...

92
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:25,732
I'm pretty sure there's gonna
be snacks in Florida, Scully.

93
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,233
Pretty sure?

94
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:29,636
Do you arrest someone if you're
pretty sure they're guilty?

95
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:31,472
No, Amy,
you wait till you get all the facts!

96
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,141
Hey, okay, everyone,
let's just try to bring things

97
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:35,642
we actually need
for the mission.

98
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:38,912
Really?
Then what is this?

99
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:41,715
Oh, it's a book of 4,000
essential photos of Nikolaj

100
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:42,883
for me to show Jake.

101
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:44,551
All right, bad news.

102
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:45,986
I talked to
Captain Stentley again.

103
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:48,088
He still won't give us
permission to go to Florida.

104
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,823
I even brought out the big guns.

105
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,859
Left, right, left, right,

106
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,260
both, both, both.

107
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,729
That's so cool!

108
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,698
I still can't let you
go to Florida, though.

109
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,166
Terry feels like a whore.

110
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:02,002
He said if we disobey him,
there'll be tire consequences.

111
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,737
I think he meant dire.

112
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:04,938
Guy's real dumb.

113
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,106
Who's with me?

114
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:08,275
Great, Hitchcock's in.
Who else?

115
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,643
I actually had a question.

116
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:11,311
How mad would everyone be
if I just bailed?

117
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:13,747
Shut up, Hitchcock.
Obviously, we're all going.

118
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:16,216
What's up, squadron?

119
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:18,652
I'm airplane ready,
and I'm T-minus 30

120
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,853
from my Ambies kicking in,

121
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:22,756
so let's take it
to the skies.

122
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,358
Yeah, about that.

123
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,994
Um, there were no tickets left.

124
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:28,862
But I brought my minivan, so...

125
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:30,696
Road trip!

126
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,170
I went to a 24-hour vet

127
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:37,905
and got surgical supplies.

128
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,806
I was in and out like a ninja.

129
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,208
Needles, needles, need...

130
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,342
whoa!

131
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:46,413
So many dogs!

132
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,948
I'll need your assistance.

133
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,117
You'll have to pull out the pipe
and stitch up the wound.

134
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:52,152
All right.
This is gonna hurt.

135
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,520
But I'm gonna get you
through it.

136
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,123
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw
up into your cut.

137
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,424
Ahhh, I saw inside of you.

138
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:58,892
How are humans alive?

139
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,894
Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery,

140
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,963
and, uh, you just breathe, okay?

141
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:04,031
We'll get you through this.

142
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:06,065
Okay.

143
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,702
Ugh, what was that sound?

144
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:10,237
I did not like
that squish sound.

145
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,506
The pipe has been removed.

146
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:15,175
Now...

147
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,344
I'm sewing myself up.

148
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,146
Okay, this is almost over.

149
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:20,614
You're doing great.

150
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:21,848
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.

151
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:22,849
Talking about what?

152
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,519
Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,753
You must be excited to see her.

154
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:27,854
Very much, you know.

155
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:29,389
Oh, God, what if it
doesn't go well?

156
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,757
We haven't seen each other
in a while,

157
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,226
and what if it's weird?

158
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:34,161
- Uhhh!
- Keep going, keep going.

159
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:36,463
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?

160
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:37,564
I don't know.
I don't know.

161
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:38,932
I mean, maybe we've grown apart.

162
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,701
Maybe she'll be repulsed
by my frosted tips.

163
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:42,803
I was gonna defrost them before
I saw her for the first time.

164
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:45,672
I'm sure it will be magical
when you see her.

165
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:47,007
And...

166
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:48,008
guess what?

167
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,009
- What?
- I'm done.

168
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,978
I've sewn myself up.

169
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,713
- Huh.
- You did great, buddy.

170
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,281
I'm proud of you.

171
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,383
I can't believe I did it.

172
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:57,818
I'm so strong.

173
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,653
Ooh, we're crossing
into Virginia.

174
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:02,256
Virginia is not
technically a state,

175
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:03,356
but a commonwealth.

176
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,391
Oof, poor Jake.

177
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:06,293
Uhh, this might be
the Ambies speaking,

178
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,729
but this in-flight movie sucks.

179
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,964
So, uh, you already
moved the twins

180
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:12,699
onto a booster seat, huh?

181
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,734
Aren't they a little
young for that?

182
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:14,735
They're four.

183
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:15,902
Nikolaj is four,

184
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,170
but we're sticking
with the car seat

185
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:19,139
as long as possible,
but you know me...

186
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,540
I'm a "safety at all costs"
kind of dad.

187
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,541
Mm-hmm.

188
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:22,843
Sarge, I need to go
to the bathroom.

189
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:24,244
We just stopped for gas.

190
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:25,245
I asked you if you had to go.

191
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:26,413
I didn't have to then.

192
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:29,049
So does this van have
side-impact airbags?

193
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,083
Not in the back.

194
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:31,585
Oh. Interesting.

195
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:32,786
No judgment here.

196
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,221
Sarge, I have to pee now too.

197
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,390
Seriously?
You, Diaz?

198
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,458
Look, I'll turn off
at the next exit, okay?

199
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,626
I have to pee really badly.

200
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:40,961
Hot.

201
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:42,262
- What?
- Hitchcock!

202
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,697
- Guys, enough!
- Sarge...

203
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:45,299
Yeah, I know!
You got to pee, I got it!

204
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,800
- No, brake lights!
- Oh, crap.

205
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,635
Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!

206
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:52,939
Did you get breakfast?

207
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,776
I tried, but I got recognized.

208
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:57,811
Do I know you from somewhere?

209
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:00,013
Do you watch a lot
of pornography?

210
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:02,382
'Cause I'm in most of it.

211
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:04,685
Oh, boy.
What if you were followed?

212
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,053
I don't think it's safe
to stay here.

213
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,054
Where are we gonna go?

214
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:10,557
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!

215
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:11,624
Do we have any weapons?

216
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,893
I have the pipe
we pulled out of me.

217
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,128
I would sooner surrender
than go anywhere near

218
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,530
your gooey body pipe.

219
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,932
Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.

220
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,869
- Oh!
- Jake?

221
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,304
Amy...

222
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:25,539
It's so good to see you.

223
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,410
Thank you guys
so much for coming.

224
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:32,777
I can't wait to catch up
with all of you

225
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:33,777
when this is done.

226
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,912
My dad died, and...

227
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,547
Again, when this is done,
Hitchcock.

228
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,082
Gina, you look like
a fresh wizard,

229
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
and I love it.

230
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,252
So we know that Figgis
is in Coral Palms,

231
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,620
but we don't know where he is,

232
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:44,522
and we don't know how many
guys he's got with him.

233
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,991
The plan is to lure them into
the Fun Zone and ambush them.

234
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:49,193
- Any questions?
- Yes, did you miss us?

235
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:51,095
Did you ever
look up at the moon

236
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,063
and wonder if I was
looking at it too?

237
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,565
- Yes.
- Knew it.

238
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,233
All right, once we get
to the Fun Zone,

239
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:58,102
I'll fill everyone in
on the mission details.

240
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,402
You guys come with me.

241
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,971
Captain, you stay here and rest.

242
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,940
What?
I don't need to rest.

243
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,471
I'm in peak condition.

244
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,505
All right, then stand up.

245
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:06,505
Easy.

246
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:12,946
I love standing up.

247
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,046
Yeah, you're staying here.

248
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:16,416
Aw, Captain,
don't worry, okay?

249
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,751
My sleeping pills
are doing their job,

250
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:21,720
and I can stay here
and take care of you, okay?

251
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:23,422
Terry, I'm gonna
need your gun.

252
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:24,457
That's not happening.

253
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,026
All right, I'll use my own.

254
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:27,594
Oops-a-daisy.

255
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,595
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?

256
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,298
Vending machine
at a rest stop.

257
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:34,100
Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.

258
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:36,603
And stay on your phone for
logistical support as planned.

259
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:37,971
Now come on, guys,
let's get ready.

260
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:43,643
Hey, we never really
got a chance to say hi.

261
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,312
Yeah. Hi.

262
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:46,713
Hi.

263
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,481
Oh, my God, everyone,

264
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:49,616
Jake and Amy are going to kiss

265
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:51,250
for the first time
in six months.

266
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:53,252
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.

267
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,689
So everyone's just
gonna watch us?

268
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,756
Yes!
Now get to it, you lovebirds.

269
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:01,461
Here we go.

270
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:02,495
Come on, man.

271
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:03,897
How did you get there so fast?

272
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:05,966
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.

273
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,000
Welcome to the Fun Zone.

274
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,869
I know the manager, and he's
agreed to shut the place down

275
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,938
for the day, so there won't
be any civilians around.

276
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:12,939
Smart.

277
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,107
You put up all these fake signs

278
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,475
about a major
health code violation.

279
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:16,943
No, those are actually
always there...

280
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:19,212
something about lead being in
the air and water and ground.

281
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:20,847
Anyways, you all have
your assignments.

282
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,282
Let's plan an ambush.

283
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:24,784
Nine-Nine! NineNine!

284
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:25,852
Chills, you guys.

285
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:28,154
Literally, chills.

286
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:30,957
Hey there, Nikolaj.

287
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:31,957
It's your papa.

288
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:33,293
If you're watching this,

289
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:34,861
something bad has
happened to me.

290
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:37,964
But I want you to know
that I love you very much.

291
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,300
You want to stop filming
yourself and help me with

292
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,633
these many items I'm carrying?

293
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:44,270
Sorry, I was making
a video for my son.

294
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:46,773
You know, in case
I never see him again.

295
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:49,209
Do you not do that
for your kids?

296
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,510
Of course I do.

297
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:53,078
I make those kind of videos
all the time.

298
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:56,449
You know, in fact, I was about
to do one right now.

299
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,284
Hey... hey, girls.

300
00:09:58,285 --> 00:09:59,652
It's me, Daddy.

301
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:02,055
If you're seeing this,
I'm dead.

302
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:05,792
But I want you to know
that I love you now and forever.

303
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:08,527
Okay, time for a lullaby,
sung in your native Latvian.

304
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:10,696
Ligo! Ligo! Ligo!

305
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,599
Yeah, yeah, lullaby time.
Look.

306
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,535
<i>Go to sleep, Daddy's dead</i>

307
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:19,038
<i>But his ghost's
always watching</i>

308
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,615
What the hell are
you guys doing?

309
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,044
Good call.
Blocking the door.

310
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,378
Keep it up, smorty-pants.

311
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,446
- Oh...
- Uh...

312
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:28,081
Mwah.

313
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,549
One of our classic
forehead smooches,

314
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,549
just like I planned.

315
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,686
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?

316
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:34,687
- What?
- Huh?

317
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:35,755
Yeah.
I mean, no.

318
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:36,756
No, things aren't weird,

319
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:37,857
or no to the sex?

320
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,492
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.

321
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,995
Just concentrate on Figgis,
and we'll figure this out later.

322
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,897
No, I was gonna say
maybe we should talk,

323
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:45,932
but yeah, it can wait
till after Figgis.

324
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,933
Ah.

325
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,435
We have the rest
of our lives to talk.

326
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:49,869
Yeah, unless he
kills us first.

327
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,604
What a weird joke.

328
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,872
Regret saying that one.

329
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,774
Wow, things are clickin'.

330
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,144
I'm gonna go make sure

331
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,405
there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.

332
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:01,581
Yup.

333
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:04,317
Important to get on them balls.

334
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,552
What is wrong with me?

335
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,288
So then Trevor sends me
a text, and he's like,

336
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,190
"At this point, I hate you."

337
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,558
I'm like, "Oh, really?

338
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,058
'Cause you didn't
hate me last week."

339
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:14,594
Trevor sounds like a dog.

340
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:17,130
Right?
God, I missed our daily dishes.

341
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,131
Me too.

342
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:19,365
I'm sorry I'm not
reciprocating

343
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,467
with "hot goss" of my own.

344
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,868
I'm just worried
about the Nine-Nine.

345
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,602
Sir, they're gonna be fine.

346
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:24,637
They're my squad.

347
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,573
I should be there with them.

348
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:28,842
This is killing me.

349
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:31,544
Well, I'm not gonna let it.

350
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:32,712
Let's go.

351
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:34,080
But my wound, Gina.

352
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,483
Sir, with your brain
and my body...

353
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:38,017
and my brain...

354
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,361
we make one unstoppable unit.

355
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:42,222
Now climb aboard, sir.

356
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,759
And let's go.

357
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:48,927
Oof.

358
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,373
All right, everybody ready?

359
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,801
Good.
Let's set this trap.

360
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:03,676
Hello.

361
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,145
- Hello, Figgis.
- <i>Peralta.</i>

362
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,715
Congratulations
on escaping prison.

363
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:11,017
Thank you.
Congrats on sucking.

364
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,552
You know, I'm bored.

365
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,354
I'd love to kill you tonight.

366
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:15,821
So where you hiding?

367
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,257
Wouldn't you like you know?

368
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:18,900
<i>Round one.</i>

369
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:20,693
You're never gonna find me.

370
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,262
<i>I'm invisible.</i>

371
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:25,098
Mommy, I won!
I won a big pwize!

372
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,533
<i>Downtown!</i>

373
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:29,334
I'm everywhere,
and I'm nowhere.

374
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,037
<i>And I'm coming for you.</i>

375
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,305
Peace out, loser.

376
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,110
He's at the Fun Zone.
Gear up.

377
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,512
This ends tonight.

378
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:40,613
Uh!

379
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,515
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry, babe.

380
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:44,272
What were you aiming for?

381
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:51,155
Hey, got you a bag
of Blue Rad-berry slushie

382
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:52,423
for the swelling.

383
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:53,524
I would've just gotten ice,

384
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:56,127
but a possum died
in the ice machine.

385
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,595
- Cool.
- Yeah.

386
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,196
Why do we keep
hurting each other?

387
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:00,431
I don't know.

388
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:01,465
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

389
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,500
It just feels like we're not...

390
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,634
- On the same page.
- Clicking.

391
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,035
That was basically
the same thing.

392
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,204
- I count that.
- Yeah.

393
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,039
Look, I know this
isn't the right time

394
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,074
for some big talk,
but I just...

395
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,609
want us to be normal again.

396
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:15,513
Yeah, me too.

397
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,048
I hope you're a better
kisser than Holt.

398
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,882
- What?
- Why did I say that?

399
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,184
Why did you kiss Holt?

400
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,786
I didn't. I did.

401
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:23,520
We did it to get out of jail,

402
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:24,722
but it didn't mean anything.

403
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,524
Just forget I said
anything, right?

404
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:29,560
Rewind.

405
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:31,729
- And kiss.
- Jake...

406
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,730
You want to know
if there was tongue.

407
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:33,998
I can tell you,
decidedly there was not.

408
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,266
No, Jake.
Figgis is here.

409
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,436
Okay, well, good talk.
Don't die.

410
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,471
Holt had very soft lips.

411
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,672
Wish I hadn't said
that one either.

412
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:42,673
- We should get into positions.
- Yeah, okay.

413
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,575
Hey, kill the lights!
Figgis is here!

414
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,616
Excuse me, ma'am,
this dolly's being used.

415
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,051
<i>Broccoli Che visto?</i>

416
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,820
It's being used.

417
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:56,954
<i>Quanti erala Vito la Bella?</i>

418
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,956
<i>Tutto matro lamente?</i>

419
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:00,877
Just bring it back
when you're done.

420
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:03,254
<i>Ah! Garbanzo marinara!</i>

421
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:04,896
<i>Pizzería restaurante!</i>

422
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:06,257
<i>Ahh!</i>

423
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,868
Jackpot.
Let's do this.

424
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:14,105
And how am I supposed
to get all the way up there?

425
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,405
Gracefully.

426
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,408
- Boost my bottom!
- I'm boosting!

427
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,443
Boost my bottom!

428
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,945
I'm boosting!

429
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:23,214
Boost it!

430
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,182
Ah. All right...

431
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:26,784
stick shift.

432
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,586
I can't drive stick shift.

433
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:29,854
You're gonna have to drive.

434
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,454
How? My leg doesn't work.

435
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,158
Sir, I am a dancer.

436
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,259
I will be your legs.

437
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:37,328
Clutch in.

438
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,329
- Okay.
- Clutch out.

439
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:41,165
- Oh!
- Hoo-hoo!

440
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,268
<i>We are the best driver
in the world!</i>

441
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,542
Spread out and find 'em.

442
00:14:57,182 --> 00:15:00,150
Bogie headed to the ball pit.

443
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:02,520
<i>Is that all you got?
I'll take your best shot</i>

444
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:05,022
<i>I'll take your best shot,
I'll take your best shot!</i>

445
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,357
<i>Boom <i> - <i>Here comes the.

446
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:08,259
<i>Boom <i> - <i>Ready or not.

447
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,694
<i>Here comes the boys
from the South</i>

448
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,596
<i>- <i>Is that all you got? <i>
- <i>I'll take your best shot.

449
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,432
<i>- <i>Well, it's all right <i>
- <i>I'll take your best shot

450
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,067
<i>- <i>I'll take your best shot <i>
- <i>Boom.

451
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,535
<i>Here comes the <i> - <i>Boom.

452
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:20,638
<i>Ready or not,
ha ha, how you like me now?</i>

453
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,672
Peralta...

454
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,375
Holt.

455
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:27,144
I know you're here.

456
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:30,214
I'm gonna kill you.

457
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:32,316
- I don't think so.
- Oh...

458
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:35,386
Put down the weapon, Figgis.

459
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,787
There you go.

460
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,556
Oh, yes.

461
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:41,759
I've been waiting for this
moment a long time.

462
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,761
You ruined my life.

463
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:45,895
I had to live in Florida
for six months!

464
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,331
It's the worst.

465
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,832
Have you tried
the pizza down here?

466
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,835
Yeah, it's the most disgusting
thing I've ever tasted.

467
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:53,037
It somehow burned my mouth
and is cold at the same time.

468
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,505
But none of that changes
the fact that you're about

469
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,040
to go to prison for
the rest of your life.

470
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,508
Drop it, Sherbert!

471
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,143
What? No!

472
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:02,013
I've been everywhere,
and I finally spotted your minivan

473
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:04,248
with the New York plates
parked around back.

474
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:07,118
We already got all your friends.
So drop it.

475
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,353
You don't understand.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.

476
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,589
This is Jimmy Figgis;
he's wanted by the FBI.

477
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,890
No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio,

478
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,260
and I came here to repair
a skee ball machine

479
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,162
on the the fritz, but suddenly
he's trying to kill me.

480
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:20,998
He's lying.
"Constantine Binvoglio."

481
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,566
It's clearly a name
he just made up.

482
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,834
I'm very impressed.
That was pretty good.

483
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,135
I will shoot you, Sherbert.

484
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,605
All right, fine,
I will put down my weapon,

485
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:30,207
but you have to promise me
you will not let this man go.

486
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,682
Okay, well, we're gonna
cuff everyone,

487
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:40,718
and then we're gonna
sort this all out.

488
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,387
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.

489
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,357
No!

490
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,892
Now let's me and you
take a little walk.

491
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:51,461
Ooh.

492
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,042
How do you think you're
getting out of this, Figgis?

493
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:57,310
Do you even have a plan?

494
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:59,612
I'm gonna hold you hostage
to get away.

495
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,047
Then I'm gonna drive
to a gas station

496
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:02,281
where I'll steal a clean car

497
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,449
and head for the airport,

498
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,251
where I'll buy a ticket
with my false ID,

499
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,786
then kill you in the parking lot

500
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:08,421
and disappear again.

501
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:09,856
Pfft.

502
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,356
You're scrambling.

503
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:16,596
Look, I told you, we're NYPD.

504
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,631
- Yeah, right.
- I can prove it.

505
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,900
Look up "Brooklyn detective
attacked by birds."

506
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,869
You'll see an article
with a photo of me.

507
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,836
<i>Officer down.</i>

508
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,371
<i>All available units respond.</i>

509
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:27,006
I'm gonna give you a window,
and you're gonna go after Jake.

510
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:29,808
My name is Detective
Rosa Diaz, NYPD.

511
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:32,945
- Get back.
- I'm reaching for my badge.

512
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,953
Keep walking.

513
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:42,655
Let him go.

514
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:44,490
Put that gun down, or he dies.

515
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,691
He's not gonna shoot me.

516
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:46,993
He needs me alive
to get out of here.

517
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,461
Yeah, you willing
to take that bet?

518
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:49,829
I wouldn't.

519
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,199
Now put the gun down.

520
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,706
Oh!

521
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:02,241
You shot him!

522
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:04,544
Are you okay?

523
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:05,711
I'm sorry I shot you.

524
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:06,813
I thought that's
what the nod meant.

525
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:07,980
It was. It was awesome.

526
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:09,282
It was actually just like
the end of "Speed,"

527
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,650
which is a pretty good movie.

528
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,084
It's not as good as "Die Hard."
"Die Hard"'s perfect.

529
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,553
Okay, Jake, I'm gonna
go after Figgis.

530
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,288
Yeah, I was gonna say, you
should keep going after Figgis.

531
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:16,923
Same page, still.

532
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:18,090
Get out of the car!

533
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,461
Young Jeezy take the wheel!

534
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,133
Freeze, punk!

535
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:29,235
Yeah, freeze, punk!

536
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:30,870
Gina, where did you
get that gun?

537
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:33,139
Lost and found at
the storage facility.

538
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,408
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.

539
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:41,147
Hey, Figgis.

540
00:18:41,148 --> 00:18:43,482
My fiancé, Adrian Pimento,
said when I caught you,

541
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:46,219
I should read you this letter.

542
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,521
"I want to lick the skin
off your body, baby."

543
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,456
Oh, that side's for me.

544
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:53,960
"I want to rip the skin
off your body, Jimmy."

545
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,761
We're sorry we
doubted you, sir.

546
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:56,881
You really saved our butts.

547
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,798
I can't take credit for that.

548
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,933
Gina Linetti is the real
hero here.

549
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,836
But isn't Gina Linetti
more of a state of mind?

550
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:07,206
Like, in a way, we were all
Gina Linetti today.

551
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,808
Gina, let's take this Gina
to the hospital.

552
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:15,081
Hey, how's the sheriff?

553
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:17,583
Well, he keeps yelling,
"Disability for life!"

554
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,585
So I think he's fine.

555
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,420
Also, Coral Palms PD
found your marshal

556
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,289
at Figgis's hideout,
alive at well.

557
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,590
Oh, that's great.

558
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:26,092
Yeah. How are you doing?

559
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,527
Fine... you know, just getting
bandaged up.

560
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:30,763
Actually, can you
give us a second?

561
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:32,765
Thanks.

562
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:33,766
It hurts so bad.

563
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,800
I just didn't want
to seem weak

564
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,303
in front of EMT Craig.

565
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,171
So I know this
is weird to say,

566
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:40,306
because I just shot you,

567
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,608
but it feels like we're
back in sync now.

568
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,744
Yeah, I mean, as in sync
as I've ever been

569
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:46,379
with someone who just shot me.

570
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:54,153
I love you.

571
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:55,922
I love you too.

572
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,757
Hey, do you happen
to know my blood type?

573
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:58,758
Yeah. B positive.

574
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,759
Well, guessed wrong.

575
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,570
Hey, Craig?

576
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:04,096
Hey, Captain Stentley,
we're back.

577
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:05,231
How was Florida?

578
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:06,966
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.

579
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:07,967
Come on, man.

580
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:09,268
Now, before you say anything,

581
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:11,504
I know we disobeyed
a direct order.

582
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,406
Sergeant, relax, okay?

583
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:16,509
Your friends were in trouble;
you did what you had to do.

584
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,144
And now I got to do
what I got to do.

585
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:20,446
Oh, no, a memorandum
of admonishment?

586
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,548
Much worse... you're never
gonna see the sun again.

587
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:24,817
Your families... they're gonna
forget your faces.

588
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:27,520
You'll eat lunch at dinnertime
and dinner at breakfast.

589
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,787
And you'll...

590
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,793
Ah, what was I talking about?

591
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,860
I totally lost my train.

592
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:37,663
- You were punishing us.
- Yes, thank you.

593
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:38,698
Ah!

594
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,032
I'm transferring the whole squad

595
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,367
to the night shift.

596
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:46,505
Noooo!

597
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,506
Yes.

598
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:53,685
