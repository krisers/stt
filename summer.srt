- Yeah, thanks. That-that's nice of you.

609
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,635
[Helen] You know, I
think I remember David.

610
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:36,803
He had a friend, right?
What was his name?

611
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:39,706
Who?

612
00:49:39,774 --> 00:49:42,776
Didn't he hang out with this guy?
And they were really close.

613
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:46,446
- God, what was his name? Um.
- Oh, I-I-I don't know.

614
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:49,282
I didn't-- I didn't know
too many of David's friends.

615
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,418
Oh.

616
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:56,089
But there was
one guy, one guy.

617
00:49:56,157 --> 00:49:58,992
He-he stopped by not too long
after David's death,

618
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,461
and-and he came
to pay his respects.

619
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:06,466
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
He was a really nice guy.

620
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,869
He was cute and smart and--

621
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:12,405
well, we were-- we were
sweet on each other...

622
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:16,176
For about two minutes,
but it didn't work out.

623
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:21,281
You know, he did-- he never really said it,
but I think it hurt him to be around me.

624
00:50:23,017 --> 00:50:25,518
Where is
this old friend now?

625
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:28,388
Oh, I-- I don't know.

626
00:50:28,456 --> 00:50:31,892
Do you remember his name?
Billy.

627
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,463
Did he have a last name?
Blue. Billy Blue.

628
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:41,167
Well, you know what?
We should probably wait back at the car.

629
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:44,037
<i>No, don't be ridiculous.
Why don't-- uh, stay.</i>

630
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:46,740
No, I-I don't, I don't want
to miss triple a.

631
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:49,643
<i>We appreciate the phone.
Anytime, you know.</i>

632
00:50:49,711 --> 00:50:53,179
I-I don't get too many knocks
on my door nowadays.

633
00:50:53,247 --> 00:50:56,083
You okay?

634
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,886
I wigged out.
I'm sorry.

635
00:50:59,954 --> 00:51:03,423
But being in his house
and seeing his sister--

636
00:51:04,558 --> 00:51:07,094
God. Do you see
what we've done?

637
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:11,564
It was an accident.

638
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:17,971
Helen, we killed a man, and then
ruined the lives of everyone he knew.

639
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,242
I don't think we're that powerful, Julie.
You're giving us too much credit.

640
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,546
Hey!

641
00:51:28,282 --> 00:51:33,219
You forgot your cigarettes.
Thank you.

642
00:51:35,356 --> 00:51:38,025
Well, I see you've got this
car started, didn't you?

643
00:51:38,092 --> 00:51:42,362
Yeah, damnedest thing.
It started right up.
Funny how that happens.

644
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,818
So, what now?

645
00:52:04,886 --> 00:52:08,354
Now we try and locate
this Billy Blue.

646
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,528
Maybe he wanted
to die.

647
00:52:17,398 --> 00:52:21,034
What?
David Egan.

648
00:52:21,102 --> 00:52:25,972
His girlfriend was killed on that
same road July 4, one year earlier.

649
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,476
Maybe he blamed himself.
Maybe he was sitting in the road
waiting for us to hit him.

650
00:52:31,612 --> 00:52:34,414
Yeah, if that will help you
sleep at night.

651
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:40,187
What happened between us?

652
00:52:40,254 --> 00:52:42,322
We used to be
best friends.

653
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:46,459
We used to be
a lot of things.

654
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:49,562
I miss you.

655
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:58,205
Yeah, well.

656
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:14,020
[TV commentator #1]
Low in the dirt, ball two.

657
00:53:14,088 --> 00:53:16,957
[Commentator #2] Garrett doesn't seem
to have his typical control today, Greg.

658
00:53:17,024 --> 00:53:21,361
In fact, this is as wild as we've
ever seen him in the season.

659
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:24,330
[Greg] That's right, Dave. In
fact, over the last three games,

660
00:53:24,398 --> 00:53:28,735
he's only allowed three bases on balls,
not one of those runners ever scoring.

661
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:31,437
Pretty remarkable indeed as
neale steps back into the box--

662
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:34,307
Hey, dad.
One to nothing here in the third.

663
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,377
Garrett taking his time.
Here's the pitch.

664
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:42,382
Strike one.
[Dave] Wicked cut. Neale
seemed fooled by that pitch.

665
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:44,651
In fact, in addition
to the split-fingered fastball--

666
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:48,855
[continues, indistinct]

667
00:53:50,424 --> 00:53:52,993
[Greg] Ready now with the
sign and the pitch. Fouled off.

668
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,330
Strike two.
Last year, neale would've
been sending that pitch...

669
00:53:57,398 --> 00:54:01,301
Over to the next County.
[Dave] It's true.

670
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:04,337
[Commentary continues, indistinct]

671
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,684
[Greg] And the pitch.
Very high and very inside.

672
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,786
[Dave]
I don't know what it is.

673
00:54:19,854 --> 00:54:23,356
[Greg] I couldn't agree more, as the
count is full now at three and two.

674
00:54:23,424 --> 00:54:28,428
Garrett settling himself,
looking at the sign.

675
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:32,265
Here's the windup.

676
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,035
There's a smash up the middle!
[Continues, indistinct]

677
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:39,405
They got him!
[Dave] Nice play at second.
Wow, what a play.

[Faint breathing]

681

[Gasps] Hey, is the washed-up,
dried-out has-been having a moment?

682
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:57,217
What do you want?

683
00:55:57,285 --> 00:56:01,354
We're doing inventory
at the store tomorrow.
I need you there by 10:00.

684
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:05,225
I can't.
I'm in the parade tomorrow.

685
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:11,731
Well, dad put me in charge of the
store, and I want you there by 10:00.

686
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:17,737
The outgoing queen has to ride in
the parade prior to the pageant.

687
00:56:17,805 --> 00:56:20,773
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.

688
00:56:23,044 --> 00:56:27,880
You and your hair.
It is so pathetic.

689
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:30,116
You can leave now.

690
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:33,053
So very pathetic.

You sure he was dead?
Don't ask me that again!

709
00:59:49,517 --> 00:59:53,620
He was dead, okay?
I saw him with-- with these crabs.

710
00:59:55,222 --> 00:59:57,223
You do it.

711
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:14,641
No, don't even-- he was there, goddamn it!
And he was wearing your jacket, Barry.

712
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:17,544
Well, where'd he go?
Did the crabs carry him away?

713
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:21,347
I swear to God.
I believe you, Julie.

714
01:00:21,415 --> 01:00:23,583
He took the body.
He came and he took the body.

715
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:26,419
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know, Barry. Okay?

716
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:29,922
Why would he try to run you over?
Why did he make coleslaw on Helen's head?

717
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,659
- He's fucking with us!
- Come on, Julie.
Let's go back to the house.

Don't you see?
He's got us now.

720
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:43,236
This is exactly what he wants.
We can't go to the police. Not
now. He's made sure of that.

721
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:48,508
He's just out there and
he's watching us and waiting.

What are you talking--</i>

You took my jacket.

from the start, weren't you?
Always wantin' to be our friend,

737
01:01:44,598 --> 01:01:47,032
but you were too fuckin'
jealous to handle it.

together, all right?</i>

740
01:01:53,006 --> 01:01:55,040
We have to help each other.

741
01:02:01,815 --> 01:02:06,218
Okay, so if it's not fisher boy here,
who is it and how do we find him?

742
01:02:06,287 --> 01:02:08,254
We think his name
is Billy Blue.

743
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:11,758
How do you know that?

744
01:02:11,825 --> 01:02:14,394
Missy said there was
a friend named Billy Blue.

745
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:18,130
Who probably went to school
with David Egan.
So, according to sis,

746
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:20,667
that would make him
class of '92.

747
01:02:20,734 --> 01:02:22,735
Elsa was class of '92.

748
01:02:22,803 --> 01:02:25,271
Maybe there's something
in her yearbook.

749
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:29,676
<i>That's him, huh?
It's hard to believe that's the guy.</i>

750
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:32,478
Yeah, his face isn't splattered
all over the road, dumb ass.

751
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:37,383
Maybe Blue's not
his real name.

752
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:41,487
That's right. I mean, he could've
easily lied to Missy. We did.

753
01:02:41,555 --> 01:02:45,658
We should bring the yearbook to Missy.
If she had it-- she could point him out.

754
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:48,127
I'm not goin' anywhere.

755
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:54,600
Wh-- high school
mug shots? Wh--

756
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:59,271
