A mysterious murderer with a hook for a hand, known as Billy Blue, kills a man on the road on July 4th, leading to a series of events involving Barry Egan, the protagonist, and a group of friends who try to uncover the identity of the killer and track him down. The investigation leads them to suspect David Egan, who is presumed dead due to an accident, and then to a local fisherman who murdered him. Barry suspects that Egan was involved in a prank gone awry, leading him to contact Barry's parents and launch a search for him, believing him to be innocent. However, when they discover the truth and discover that Egan actually killed the victim and hid the body in a nearby lake, they realize that Egan was planning a suicide and had obtained a hook to execute him. The group tries to rescue Barry, but he becomes separated from them and eventually ends up in the river, where the hook accidentally punctures his skin and he dies. Despite the tragic outcome, the group continues to investigate and gather clues, eventually finding out that Egan was targeting Barry's grandmother for revenge.
