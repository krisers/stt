﻿1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,246
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02,247 --> 00:00:03,362
Sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,331
So what's this secret meeting
all about?

4
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,449
You guys know I'm not
medically cleared

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,449
for another week.

6
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:10,002
It's not a secret meeting, Jake.

7
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:11,337
It's an intervention.

8
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:12,469
The tips have to go.

9
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,307
What?
Why?

10
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,210
Jake, we're worried about you,
and you look very stupid.

11
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:18,260
C'mon, guys.

12
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:20,046
I think they're
kind of cool, retro.

13
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:21,047
No, they're terrible.

14
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:22,048
Amy, come on.

15
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,289
You're digging the tips, right?

16
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,209
No, I feel like
I'm kissing Vanilla Ice.

17
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,805
There was a time you would've
jumped at that chance.

18
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:27,969
They have to go.

19
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,189
All right, you guys got me.

20
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,557
I did it as a joke.

21
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:32,642
I kept them ironically.

22
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,527
Pretty funny, right?

23
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:35,811
I'm just gonna head out.

24
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:36,896
- Get him!
- No!

25
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,816
Yes, Terry!

26
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:44,403
Okay, okay.

27
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,372
Wait, wait, okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

28
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:47,372
I'll admit it.

29
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,076
I went too deep
down there in Florida.

30
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:53,579
At one point, I think I forgot
where the tip of me ended,

31
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,248
and the base of the tips began.

32
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:56,990
Before we just chop 'em off,

33
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,668
'would anybody like to say
some final words?

34
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:00,753
- No.
- That was one word.

35
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:01,754
That counts.
Thank you, Rosa.

36
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:02,755
Okay, I'm ready.

37
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:06,092
Sorry I'm late everyone,
but trust me, it's worth it.

38
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,427
Me and Jake are tip buds.

39
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:09,427
What?

40
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:10,846
No!

41
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,934
No!

42
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:16,068
You know what... I do see it.
It's bad.

43
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,068
It looks bad.

44

Brace yourselves

Don't everybody mob me at once.
We can high-five one at a time.

48
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:48,801
Oh, I see...

49
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,052
no response.

50
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:51,687
A little "welcome back
to the precinct" hazing.

51
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:52,972
Who's behind this cute
little prank? Diaz?

52
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:54,006
Kill yourself.

53
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:54,974
Okay.

54
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:56,025
I told you.

55
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,476
Night shift has everyone
a little down.

56
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,362
Yeah, just because
you don't get to sleep

57
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,897
or see your loved ones
or feel the sun

58
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:02,982
or do anything
that brings you joy.

59
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:03,982
That's all.

60
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:05,952
I personally like
the night shift.

61
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,289
You know who else
is up right now?

62
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:09,322
Murderers?
Armed robbers?

63
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:10,656
Australians.

64
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:13,626
It's an whole new demographic
for me to conquer.

65
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,044
I already have the third most

66
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:18,281
followers behind Iggy Azalea
and the Perth Zoo Wallaby cam.

67
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:19,465
Wow, that's pretty good.

68
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not just good, Jake.

69
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,385
It's bonzer.

70
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:24,637
Night shift is boring.
Listen to the cases I've had:

71
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:27,922
Drunk and disorderly,
drunk and disorderly, cyber crime...

72
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:28,975
Ooh, cyber crime.

73
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,009
Pretty cool.

74
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,177
Caught a drunk guy
humping a laptop.

75
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,595
Well, we've all been there.

76
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:35,348
But my point is this:
I don't care what time it is.

77
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,149
I'm always happy to be here.

78
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,017
Nine-Nine!

79
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,021
Nine-Niiine!

80
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:45,741
A-Noine-Noine!

81
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:47,410
I'm gonna keep doing it
until you guys chime in.

82
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,328
A-Noine-Noine!

83
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,667
Sergeant Jeffords, a word.

84
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:53,531
What is wrong with everyone?

85
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:57,035
I'm worried our night shift
morale problem has gotten worse.

86
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,704
Yeah, you think?

87
00:02:58,705 --> 00:02:59,872
I'm sorry.

88
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm exhausted.

89
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,759
My wife says when I get tired,
I get night sassy.

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Night sassy?

91
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,045
Hearing problems, much?

92
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,546
Sorry.

93
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:10,466
Should I just go tell everyone
to buck up and do their jobs?

94
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,852
No, the squad's only on night
shift because they came down

95
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,804
to Florida to save Jake and me.

96
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,522
It's my responsibility
to fix this,

97
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:19,892
so I'm going to brighten
the mood by telling a few jokes.

98
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:23,478
Try this one on for size:
I don't care for cheese.

99
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:25,881
I'm a...

100
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:27,565
curd-mudgeon.

101
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:31,287
Wow.

102
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:33,625
You're too tired for humor.

103
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,990
If he isn't taking his medicine,

104
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,575
you could
mix it in with his food.

105
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,244
Sorry, you can deal with
your sick dog later, Boyle.

106
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,246
Well, actually, that was
about my son, Nikolaj.

107
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:42,497
He's got allergies.

108
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:43,883
I think we may have to go
with a nasal douche.

109
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:44,884
Ah, nasal douche.

110
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:46,585
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Very gross.

111
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,304
Anyways, I'm back
to being a cop.

112
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,822
It's all I've thought about
for the last six months.

113
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:51,307
Hurtful.

114
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,259
But I won't be fully back
until I've solved a case,

115
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,427
just like old times.

116
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,145
And I can't do
that without my partner.

117
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:59,265
Pfft, you're not solving
any cases on the night shift.

118
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,266
Lohank?

119
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,267
Oh, my God, you look...

120
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,268
Beautiful?

121
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,601
I was gonna say "less sad."

122
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,571
Ever since I moved to
the day shift, I'm happier,

123
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:08,023
healthier, my stepson gave me
my debit card back.

124
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,275
Lohank is happy and confident?

125
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:10,276
Everything's off.

126
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:11,410
Oh, no.

127
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,411
We're in the Upside Down.

128
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:13,662
That's right.

129
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,197
I'm gonna tell you the same
thing they told me when

130
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:18,617
they removed my testicle:
Welcome to your new life.

131
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:21,420
Nuh-uh, I'm not gonna let
the night shift win.

132
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,922
Me and my main man Boyle
are about to solve a case.

133
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:23,923
Isn't that right, Charles?

134
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:25,591
Oh, you know we will.

135
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:27,960
We'll call ourselves
the Night Boys.

136
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:29,128
Kind of sounds like
a male escort service.

137
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,130
- The Midnight Men.
- Even worse.

138
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:32,381
The Dark Stallions.

139
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:33,966
Looks like we're going
with the Night Boys.

140
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,384
Whoo!

141
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,635
I can't believe

142
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,137
I'm gonna say this,
but the night shift is

143
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,605
taking all the fun
out of paperwork.

144
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:40,940
- Mm-hmm.
- At least we're getting to

145
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,775
- spend quality time together.
- Totally... I'll be back

146
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:43,776
in 40 minutes.

147
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:45,060
What?
Where are you going?

148
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,145
We have to finish
this by morning.

149
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,313
Yeah, I know.

150
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,231
I just have something important
I have to do.

151
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,399
What?

152
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,152
I have to get...

153
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:54,320
Some pens.

154
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,955
Then why are you putting
your jacket on?

155
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,324
- Pen store's a block away.
- The nearest pen store is seven

156
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,327
blocks away, and it doesn't open
until 9:00 a.m.

157
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:02,912
I learned that the hard way.

158
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,246
You really think you
can lie to me?

159
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,831
- No.
- A-ha!

160
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,750
You're lying to me right now.
You do think you can lie to me.

161
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,335
- Yep.
- Wait.

162
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:10,419
Hang on.

163
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,971
- Was that a lie?
- I don't know, maybe.

164
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:14,306
All right, see ya.

165
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:16,342
Ah, our first case.

166
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,893
Tasty little B&E...
just what the doctor ordered.

167
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:21,764
Not actually, she recommended
another week of bed rest.

168
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,433
I was like, "Whatever, dorkus."

169
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:27,353
Ah, check it out:
Ducking under police tape.

170
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:29,321
I missed this.

171
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:30,990
Charles...

172
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,658
Yep, yep, on it, on it, Jake-y.

173
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,326
- I got it.
- Got it.

174
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,578
What do we got?

175
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,497
Back window's broken,
two sets of sneaker prints,

176
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:42,084
alarm went off at 11:43,
and security arrived at 11:46.

177
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,202
Perps were already gone.

178
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,871
Okay, I'm thinking classic us.

179
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:47,256
I'm thinking old times.

180
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:48,340
I'm thinking...

181
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,709
Rigity-rigity-role playas!

182
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,678
Yes, okay,
I'm Jacques Guillaume,

183
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,096
and you are Henri Renault.

184
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:56,130
We are cat burglars
on vacation from France.

185
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,884
I love it... although Henri
went to an elite international

186
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,436
school, so he does not
speak with an accent.

187
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:02,388
Wow, nice, way to
flesh out the characters.

188
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,473
Thank you, okay,
so I break the back window,

189
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,058
make my way over
to the jewelry case.

190
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,943
Meanwhile, you're standing
lookout by the front door...

191
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,396
Oui, oui.

192
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:12,064
Smoking a cigarette.

193
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:13,232
Check it: Ash.

194
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,366
Ooh la la.

195
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,319
Okay, so I am smoking.

196
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,454
What are you doing?

197
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:20,656
Oh, Jacques rolls
his own cigarettes,

198
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:23,075
a habit he picked up from
a prostitute in Marseille,

199
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:25,005
but that is not all
he picked up.

200
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:26,412
Why do all
your characters get STDs?

201
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:27,796
Because they're living life!

202
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:30,466
All right, so I go
to the first case... smash...

203
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,584
steal a bunch of watches.

204
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:34,220
Move over to the second
case... smash... bracelets.

205
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,553
But then, we hear
a sound, and...

206
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:37,923
I yell, <i>"Les gendarmes!
Ils sont ici!"</i>

207
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,341
And I know what that means
because I'm French,

208
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:40,893
but I ask you to repeat it in
English, just to be sure.

209
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:42,144
Police are here.

210
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,979
Yes, we gotta get outta here,
so we turn to leave,

211
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,764
you flick your cigarette.

212
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:48,067
Using the cane, using
the cane, this is awesome.

213
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,852
Voila! Zee butt.

214
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:52,403
I thought Henri didn't
have an accent.

215
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,939
It comes out
when he gets excited.

216
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,441
Great news, everyone.

217
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,743
We just got our first lead
on our first case

218
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,279
on my first night back,
proving once and for all

219
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,665
that absolutely
nothing has changed.

220
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,001
Yeah, this opens in
instead of out now.

221
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,369
They switched it a month ago.

222
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,873
Yeah, so the door changed,
sure, but that's it.

223
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:12,811
Well, we have got
ourselves a case and

224
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,096
a key piece of evidence.

225
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,864
We should be wrapping
this thing up in no time.

226
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,499
As long as we do it
before sunup.

227
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,867
As soon as the shift is over,
I kind of have to get home.

228
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:20,869
But we're gonna work
until it's done, right?

229
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,204
I mean, that's how we do it.

230
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,373
Yeah, I just like to be home
as soon as Nikolaj wakes up

231
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:25,841
so I can make him breakfast.

232
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:28,576
Sure, yeah, not a problem...
we'll be home by sunup.

233
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,629
Just like a couple of sexy
"Twilight" vampires.

234
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:32,881
I am Robert Pattinson.

235
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:34,516
I vant to turn into a bat.

236
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,717
I've never seen the movies.

237
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,302
No, me neither... they're
an insult to the books.

238
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:38,303
Okay.

239
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:39,788
Crank up the tunes, Boyle.

240
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,556
The Night Boys need an anthem.

241
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:43,558
Something dark,
something tough, something...

242
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,043
I already got it.

243
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:48,947
You know what?

244
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,115
I'm into it.

245
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,534
The night shift
won't slow us down.

246
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:54,453
Why is this going so slow?
Where is everyone?

247
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:55,871
Well, it is 3:00 a.m.

248
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:57,205
It's a pretty bare-bones crew.

249
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,240
Hi, can I help you?

250
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,241
Are you lost?

251
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,126
Can I get you
something... coffee, tea?

252
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,127
You know what...
we're in a bit of a hurry.

253
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,245
Can you run this DNA for us?

254
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:04,329
Well, of course.

255
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,665
Sorry, not many people
stopping by at night.

256
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,301
Sometimes it makes you like...

257
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:10,585
Right?

258
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:11,586
Uh-huh.

259
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,587
I'll be back in a sec.

260
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:13,839
Cool.

261
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,142
Yikes... not exactly
the A-team at this hour.

262
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:18,644
"A-Team," are you guys
talking "A-Team"?

263
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:20,429
I love that show...
I could download it.

264
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,430
We should binge it.

265
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:22,847
This is gonna be fun.

266
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,068
Yep, totally excited to watch
five full seasons of television

267
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,104
with you, but could you actually
run the DNA for us first?

268
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:30,973
It kind of feels like you're
prioritizing work

269
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:31,990
over our friendship.

270
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,133
Because I barely know you?

271
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,944
Fine, message received.

272
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,515
Oh, welcome back from your third

273
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:41,917
massive break of the night.

274
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,119
- Thanks.
- I was being sarcastic.

275
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,954
- Where do you keep going?
- Not saying.

276
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,122
- Tell me, Diaz.
- Nope.

277
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,457
- Come on, tell me.
- Not talking about it.

278
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,841
Tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me, tell me, tell me...

279
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,209
Fine.

280
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,962
I was in the bathroom.
I'm having stomach problems.

281
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:54,963
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

282
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:56,381
- Sorry.
- It's real bad...

283
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:57,799
- No, that's all right.
- You should've been there.

284
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,017
- I don't have to hear it.
- It was like a massacre.

285
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,052
- No, you can... please stop.
- Multiple flush.

286
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,687
- Please stop.
- Attention, squad.

287
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,305
Everyone, gather 'round.

288
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,724
I've been researching ways
to raise morale, and I found

289
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,942
an interesting article
in a scientific journal.

290
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:11,780
Oh, was it from "The American
Journal of No One Cares"?

291
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:15,567
According to a recent study,
the physical act of smiling

292
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,651
can improve your mood.

293
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,152
I suggest we give it a shot.

294
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,123
Eh?

295
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:22,265
Now you all try.

296
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:28,130
Big smiles, bigger, bigger!

297
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,881
Great, now we just
have to stay like this

298
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:30,966
for the next two hours.

299
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,250
Can you feel it working?

300
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,585
I don't have any enamel
on my teeth,

301
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,220
so the cold air is excruciating.

302
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:37,389
Maybe if you brushed
your teeth once in a while,

303
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,556
this wouldn't be a problem.

304
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,208
I do brush my teeth.

305
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,394
They're decaying
from acid reflux.

306
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:43,620
You're embarrassing yourself.

307
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:44,646
Crikey.

308
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:45,981
You're not Australian, Gina.

309
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:47,899
Get stuffed, ya drongo.

310
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,152
Guys, seriously,
too much exposure to air,

311
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:51,570
and they will turn to dust.

312
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,322
This isn't working out as well
as I'd hoped.

313
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,024
Time for the next level:

314
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,744
Forced laughing.

315
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,700
Well, that lab tech
took a long time.

316
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,185
Once we agreed to go to
his birthday party,

317
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,370
he was actually pretty fast.

318
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,872
But, most importantly,
we got a DNA match.

319
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:14,760
We're looking for...
Dave Smith.

320
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,211
Sounds like a real
piece of crap.

321
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:17,295
You said it.

322
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,097
Now we just gotta
pull his files from records.

323
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:21,383
Yep, then we bust him,
and we'll be done with plenty

324
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:22,884
of time before Nikolaj wakes up.

325
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,185
Nikolaj.

326
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,719
Hm? Nikolaj, yeah, I said it.

327
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,305
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

328
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:28,890
Not even close.
Nikolaj.

329
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,409
- Nikolaj.
- Almost... Nikolaj.

330
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,626
Nikolaj... I feel
like I'm saying it.

331
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:32,978
You know what...
it doesn't matter.

332
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,413
Hit me with the music!

333
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,398
<i>♪ All night long ♪</i>

334
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,450
<i>- ♪ All night ♪
- ♪ All night ♪</i>

335
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,343
Hi there, we just need
to pull a file...

336
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:41,636
Can't... system's down.

337
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,038
They do maintenance at night.

338
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,073
That's okay, we'll just go to
another precinct.

339
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,124
- That's all.
- Yep.

340
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,210
<i>♪ All night long ♪</i>

341
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:50,162

342
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,463
Hi, can we get
this file, please?

343
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:52,497
We're in a bit of a hurry.

344
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,915
Oh, absolutely, honey.

345
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:04,509
She's going extremely slow.

346
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,261
She's going so slow.

347
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,563
There we go.

348
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,765
Oh, my glasses.

349
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,601
All right, we'll just go
to Five-Four.

350
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,070
- <i>♪ All night ♪</i>
- No.

351
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,655
Hello, hi, please,
file now, hurry.

352
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,106
Sorry, dude.

353
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:20,192
I don't know how to get
onto this system... I'm a temp.

354
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,610
May I?

355
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:25,580
Great, let me just get over...
oh, good lord, that is porn.

356
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:27,616
- Oh, is that not allowed?
- It is not.

357
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,783
No problem,
we just close these tabs...

358
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,974
- You've got a lot of them.
- Mm.

359
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,846
Type 3 and type 9
and 12 and 13...

360
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,632
those are all
the diabeteses I have.

361
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,634
It's true what they say:
Night shift makes

362
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,102
for strange bedfellows.

363
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:48,687
In your dreams, perv.

364
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,106
Ugh.
Rosa?

365
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:53,391
What the hell? She said
she was in the bathroom again.

366
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,443
Nah, she hasn't been
to the bathroom since 8:27.

367
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:56,444
What?

368
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:57,978
Also... ew.

369
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,230
C'mon, Hitchcock.

370
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,904
Busted.

371
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,406
Man, this Dave Smith's
bad news: Armed robbery,

372
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:10,208
aggravated assault,
attempted murder...

373
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,827
Well, he's about to get
a visit from the Night Boys.

374
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,880
Gah, this stupid limp
is slowing me down.

375
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:15,881
Charles, can you...

376
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,582
Oh, give you a piggy?

377
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,583
- What?
- Yeah, jump on it...

378
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:19,751
I'll give you a piggy.

379
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,303
Actually, I'm good.

380
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,004
I was just gonna ask
if you'd hold my bag.

381
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,139
Oh, yeah, sure,
makes more sense.

382
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
- Yeah.
- Embarrassed.

383
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:26,508
Anyways, this is great.

384
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,260
We're definitely gonna catch
this guy before sunup,

385
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,678
and you will be home
to see your kid.

386
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:34,232
Oh, no!

387
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,733
Son of a bitch.

388
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,417
Jake, come on in.

389
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:41,701
Nikolaj, look who it is.

390
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,286
You remember Jake Peralta.

391
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,504
From the stories.

392
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:45,622
Yeah, we talk about you
at bedtime.

393
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:46,623
Ah.

394
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:47,924
Look at my cement truck.

395
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,709
- He loves trucks.
- Cool, it's cool, buddy.

396
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,545
Hey, listen, I know you're
with your kid, but I checked

397
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:53,263
the file, and our perp's
last known address

398
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,297
is like two blocks from here.

399
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,881
Really?
We gotta go take him down.

400
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,433
Yes, there's the Charles I know.

401
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:00,102
- Tonight, Dave Smith goes down.
- Tonight?

402
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:01,638
No, Charles, we gotta go now.

403
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,607
You saw this guy's rap sheet...
he was arrested for attempted mur...

404
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,475
Tickling, tickling...
attempted tickling.

405
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,110
Right, tickling.

406
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:10,618
Look, uh, Charles, this guy's
a real... doodyhead, all right?

407
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:12,148
He tickled once...
he may tickle again.

408
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,867
He might be tickling
as we speak.

409
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:15,985
We could be dealing
with a serial tickler.

410
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:17,370
I really want to go, Jake,

411
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,289
but I'm here alone with Nikolaj.

412
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,707
Genevieve doesn't get back
for three hours.

413
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,158
So let's just take him with us.

414
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,644
Nah, that's crazy... or is it
just crazy enough to work?

415
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:25,829
Just crazy.

416
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,631
Ah, man, it stinks
you've gotta watch him...

417
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,332
it's really messing
everything up.

418
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,834
I mean, that came out wrong.

419
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,836
I love that you have a son...
it's not messing everything up.

420
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:35,388
Just messing up our ability
to solve the case and have fun.

421
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,723
Ah, you know what I mean.

422
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:38,141
I'm a nice guy...
I'm in the right.

423
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:39,141
I'll just go myself.

424
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,143
Bye, Nikolaj.

425
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,144
Nikolaj.

426
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:42,979
Yeah, whatever.
See ya.

427
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,681
I know your shift is over,
and you've had a challenging night,

428
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,685
but I think I've found
a new way to raise morale.

429
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:51,284
Follow me to the briefing room.

430
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:57,526
What's all this?

431
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:59,195
It's an after-work hang.

432
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:01,915
Just trying to turn up,
as it were.

433
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,951
We got snacks, games,
decorations, chairs...

434
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:07,621
Yes, chairs.

435
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:10,373
Cool, maybe we can mill around
and small talk about how

436
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,842
some of us are big lying liars
who lie all the time

437
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:14,794
like a bunch of liars, Rosa.

438
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:17,380
I don't think that's good
party convo.

439
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:22,286
Uh, maybe we should just name
our favorite sailing knot.

440
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,554
I'll start.

441
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,055
The bowline.

442
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,443
How about some tunes?

443
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,562
Cool, merry-go-round music.

444
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:37,233
Yeah, John Phillips Sousa,
the Skrillex of his day.

445
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,235
C'mon, people,
hit the dance floor.

446
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,954
Have a good time.

447
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:42,405
Why is no one
having a good time?

448
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,207
I specifically requested it.

449
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,625
Gina, why aren't you dancing?

450
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,877
I can't. I'm in the middle
of a feud with

451
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:51,414
the "that's not a knife" guy
from "Crocodile Dundee."

452
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:52,716
He's being a real bitch.

453
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,335
Fine, I guess I'll just...
stop the party.

454
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:56,419
I didn't realize
it ever started.

455
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,804
Enough.

456
00:14:57,805 --> 00:14:59,422
I tried to make this fun.

457
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:01,925
I even learned
what Skrillex was.

458
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,476
Sorry you're all miserable,
but guess what.

459
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,011
So am I.

460
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,397
I'm exhausted all the time,
I never see my husband,

461
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:11,334
the late-night NPR programming...
pure garbage.

462
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:15,772
I'm done trying. We can all
be miserable together.

463
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:17,078
Just go home.

464
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:20,944
Hey, I saw you earlier.

465
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,329
You weren't in the bathroom.

466
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,165
You were on a park bench
playing on your phone.

467
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,867
Yeah, you left me to do
everything while I thought

468
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,586
you were pooping.

469
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:32,756
I wish you were pooping.
I wish to God.

470
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,791
I'm sorry.

471
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:38,916
Oh, Rosa, crying...
don't know what to do.

472
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,414
Pat, pat.

473
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:42,766
This feels wrong.

474
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,101
We put away Figgis
three weeks ago.

475
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:46,519
Pimento should've been
back by now.

476
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,054
We had plans to meet on
that park bench once

477
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:50,306
the coast was clear,
but he hasn't shown up.

478
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:53,560
Maybe he's deep undercover,
or he doesn't remember who he is,

479
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,561
or maybe he's dead.

480
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,312
Wow, thanks.

481
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:57,814
You're right,
my fiancé's a total weirdo

482
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,065
who's probably dead.

483
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,651
I'll just give up on him
and go do my paperwork.

484
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:05,488
No, Diaz, wait... maybe he's
just really, really injured.

485
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:06,989
Come on, Amy.

486
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:11,044
All right,
Fiske, Jones, Thompkins...

487
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:14,497
Smith.

488
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:15,715
Smith.

489
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:18,168
Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze!

490
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,419
Slow down!
This isn't fair!

491
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,304
I have a cane.

492
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,425
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

493
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:27,594
NYPD.

494
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,713
NYPD... I need to
commandeer this vehicle.

495
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,731
It's a crossover.

496
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,850
It's a crossover SUV,
and you can't have it.

497
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,518
I'm a cop... can you please
get out of the car?

498
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,605
No, this Schmidt's mom's car,
and I'm more scared of her

499
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,119
than I am of some two-bit thug.

500
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:41,858
I'm not a thug... I'm police.

501
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,493
Okay, then name one law.

502
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:44,627
Don't kill people.

503
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,579
That's on me...
I set the bar too low.

504
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,831
Look, can you please
just get out?

505
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:50,200
Okay, you can drive,
but I'm not getting out.

506
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:51,367
- Right.
- Also, I have the seat warmer

507
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:53,369
on... I don't just have
a really hot butt.

508
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,705
Doesn't matter to me...
a perp is getting away.

509
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:57,507
Oh, it's very hot.

510
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:00,710
I can't believe
this is happening.

511
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,178
Thanks a lot, New York.

512
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,380
You know what, if your city's
so great, then how come

513
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:05,714
it's not the state capital?

514
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,801
What... who cares about
the state's capital?

515
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,053
This is the concrete jungle
where dreams are made of.

516
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:11,604
That doesn't sound right...
where dreams are made of?

517
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,022
I don't know... you tell me.

518
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,108
- It's your dumb city.
- It's grammatically odd.

519
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,893
Whatever, I'm sure wherever
you're from has strange songs

520
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:18,861
- written about it, too.
- Los Angeles?

521
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,730
Damn it, all the songs
there are so good.

522
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,734
Hey, watch my soup.

523
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm chasing a criminal.
Your soup is not important.

524
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:30,373
You took an oath
to serve and protect.

525
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:31,658
That applies to my soup.

526
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,293
You know that's not
what the oath is about.

527
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:34,878
You're making a point
you don't even believe in.

528
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,963
Garbage truck!

529
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,250
- Oh.
- Damn it!

530
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:42,252
He got away.

531
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:43,553
Well, I spilled my soup.

532
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:44,921
You tell me which is worse.

533
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:48,146
My thing.
Very clearly my thing.

534
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:49,906
Captain Holt,
can we talk to you?

535
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,629
What is the meaning of this?

536
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,547
Am I the subject of a punking?

537
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:56,801
It's a beginning-of-work hang.

538
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:58,636
And why are you all
in such good moods?

539
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,755
Because you told us
that you're miserable, too.

540
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,223
And that means
you'll fight to get us off

541
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,259
the night shift, right?

542
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,678
Well, here's what I have to
say about that: The night shift

543
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,931
stinks... stinks like a butt.
And I will do everything

544
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,901
in my power to make sure
we get back to the day shift.

545
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,436
What are we standing around for?

546
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:17,938
Put some Sousa on already.
I want to get wild.

547
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,742
Well, well, well,
if it isn't one of

548
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,243
the world-famous Night Bros.

549
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:25,196
It's the Night Boys, and...
why did I correct you?

550
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,448
I would've preferred "Bros."

551
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:27,699
Did you solve your case yet?

552
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,417
- No.
- Night shift, am I right?

553
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:30,668
You remind me of me.

554
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:32,387
It's not the night shift, okay?

555
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,873
I found the perp, and I would've
taken him down, but I'm hobbled,

556
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,958
and I didn't have a partner
because ever since Boyle

557
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,376
had a son, that's all
he can focus on.

558
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:41,679
Whoa, hey, are you angry at
Boyle for having a kid?

559
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,432
No, I'm just mad because
I'm working the night shift,

560
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,434
and I have to use a cane,
and, yes, the one thing I could

561
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,219
always count on no matter what...
Boyle being there for me...

562
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,387
is also gone.

563
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:51,439
What do you say we let
day shift Lohank take

564
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,308
a crack at this?

565
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:55,777
I'm gonna put a little
something up in the old hopper.

566
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:56,895
You tell me if it vibes
with you.

567
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:58,196
That's so gross.

568
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:01,032
Life moves forwards,
not backwards, and things

569
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,034
will never be as they were.

570
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:06,538
And you can be angry about that,
or you can embrace the fact

571
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,789
that your best friend
now has a son.

572
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:10,241
How cool is that, amigo?

573
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,460
Ugh, "amigo."

574
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,880
All right, fine, yes, I'll admit
it, it is pretty cool.

575
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:18,249
Boyle's wanted it
for a very long time.

576
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,001
I guess I haven't actually spent
that much time with Nikolaj yet.

577
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:21,336
Nikolaj.

578
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:22,971
Man, am I seriously
about to take emotional advice

579
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:24,088
from Lohank?

580
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,089
You know you want to, compadre.

581
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,595
Go to him.

582
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:33,314
Hey, I'm really sorry.

583
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:35,350
I shouldn't have said
that about Pimento.

584
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:37,018
I'm sure he's gonna come back.

585
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,603
I'm not even
thinking about it anymore.

586
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,104
That wasn't even me crying
in the bathroom earlier...

587
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:42,273
that was someone else with these
same boots, but now she's gone.

588
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:45,743
Look, when Jake was in witness
protection, and I didn't know

589
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,529
when he was ever coming back,
you were always there

590
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,947
when I needed to vent.

591
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:52,167
So I'll do your paperwork,
and if you ever want company

592
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,785
on that bench, I'm there.

593
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:56,371
Thanks... I would advise
against it though... if he does

594
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:59,457
come back, things are gonna get
real raunchy, real fast, like,

595
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,543
do a lot of licking, that's
probably indecent exposure...

596
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:03,127
- I don't want to get...
- Okay, got it.

597
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,996
You know what... I'll just start
with this stack right hehere.

598
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,998
Thanks, Rosa, okay, good talk.

599
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:11,252
Hey, what's up?

600
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,504
I can't work the case tonight.

601
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:14,138
Nikolaj's allergies
are acting up,

602
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,306
and now the dog seems to be
allergic to him.

603
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:16,758
It's this whole thing.

604
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,759
Did you find Smith?

605
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,061
No, uh, he actually got away.

606
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:22,063
- Sorry, man.
- Ah, it's all right.

607
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,731
It's the day shift's
problem now.

608
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,600
Whatever happened to
working until it's done?

609
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,321
Honestly... Lohank kind of
talked some sense into me.

610
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:33,858
- Lohank?
- Yeah, it was so gross,

611
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,661
- but I want to apologize.
- For what?

612
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:38,363
Well, I kept talking about
how I wanted everything

613
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:41,616
to go back to normal,
but if that actually happened,

614
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,784
this little guy
wouldn't be here.

615
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,035
Or is he big?

616
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,336
I don't know what size
kids are supposed to be,

617
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:46,921
or anything about kids, really.

618
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:49,541
I think maybe that's part of
the problem... it doesn't matter.

619
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,042
I got a present for Nikolaj.

620
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:54,429
Thanks, Jake.
Come on in, give it to him.

621
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,297
- Niko.
- Hey, little man.

622
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,216
A garbage truck!

623
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,051
You wanna know something cool?

624
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,804
A truck just like this
almost killed me today.

625
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:06,107
Uh, kissed me, almost kissed me.

626
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,348
Anyway, let's get some trash in
this thing... am I right?

627
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:10,676
You're silly.

628
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,488
Yeah. I am silly.

629
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,572
Oh, my God,
this is a dream come true.

630
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,293
I gotta get my phone...
I gotta film this.

631
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:17,365
Oh, but then I'll miss it.

632
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,407
Oh, but I want it forever.

633
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:19,885
Agh, but I should
stay in the moment.
