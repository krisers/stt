1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 So, do you recognize any of these men?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 I was hiding in the bathroom stall,

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,300
 so I didn't see his face, but I heard him.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,100
 He was singing along to the music at the bar.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,300
 Do you remember what he was singing?

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,600
 I think it was that song, I Want It That Way.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,400
 Backstreet Boys. I'm familiar. Okay.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,200
 Number one, could you please sing the opening

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,300
 to I Want It That Way?

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,100
 Really?

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,300
 Okay.

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,500
 You are

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,900
 my fire

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,100
 Number two, keep it going.

15
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,400
 I want the one desire

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,100
 Number three, believe when I say

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,700
 Number four, I want it that way

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,100
 Tell me why

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,500
 Ain't nothing but a heartache

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,900
 Tell me why

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,400
 Ain't nothing but a mistake

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,400
 Now number five, I never want to hear you say

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,100
 Woo!

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,400
 I want it that way

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
 Ah, chills. Literal chills.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,100
 It was number five. Number five killed my brother.

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,800
 Oh, my God. I forgot about that part.
