00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,870
The following story is fictional and
does not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:03,643 --> 00:00:05,570
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,271
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,443
In New York City,

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:14,052
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:16,961
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,616
These are their stories.

8
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:22,581
Welcome to HappiBurger.
May I take your order?

9
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:25,632
What you can take is a mop and a bucket
to the ladies room.

10
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,428
Poor kid's tossing her
cookies in there.

11
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:31,724
Thank you for your excellent feedback.
And you have a HappiBurger day.

12
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:37,419
Joel, we got a barfer in the bathroom.

13
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,190
Gee, thanks.

14
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:41,196
Highlight of my day.

15
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,464
"Joel, we got a barfer
in the bathroom."

16
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,232
Welcome to HappiBurger.

17
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:53,748
Would you like E. coli with your order?
How about a super-size of salmonella?

18
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:56,339
Please don't make me do it.

19
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:57,830
- Is everything okay in there?
- Help me.

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,935
- Trini, is that you?
- Help me.

21
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:05,359
The suspect and victim are barricaded
in the manager's office.

22
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,993
The door is reinforced steel,
so we're waiting for ESU to come boom it.

23
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:10,802
No one has keys? / Just the manager, 
Dwight Lomax. But he's MIA.

24
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:11,887
You have an ID on the victim?

25
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:15,551
One female employee unaccounted for
when we evacuated...Trini Martinez.

26
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,058
Any contact with the perp?

27
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,152
Says he'll only open the door
for Detective Milgram.

28
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,146
Did you reach out to him?

29
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,646
One PP says there is
no Milgram on the job.

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,993
Police. Open up.

31
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:28,036
Detective Milgram?
Is that you?

32
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:30,359
He's on his way. I'm his partner.

33
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,498
Oh, thank God you're here.

34
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:36,478
I did everything you told me to.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2008/04/29

52
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,604
Ah, is Detective Milgram here yet?

53
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,572
He's stuck in traffic.
He said to start without him.

54
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:41,682
That's all right. He already knows 
what happened anyway.

55
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,501
Yeah, I don't.
So why don't you fill me in?

56
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:47,976
I was sitting at my desk
working on our team-building program

57
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,930
- when Detective Milgram called.
- What did he say?

58
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,224
He said that one of my employees
stole a wallet from a customer.

59
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:55,600
And the woman was at the precinct
filling out a complaint.

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,477
So I asked what I could do. He said 
I should hold Trini until he got there,

61
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,148
so she couldn't hide any evidence.

62
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,491
So what'd you do?

63
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,337
I told her to get her thieving little butt
into my office, pronto.

64
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,586
I showed him I didn't have nothing
in my pockets but my lip gloss.

65
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,987
He got on the phone
and he told someone.

66
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:14,908
Do you know who he was talking to?

67
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:18,869
He said it was you.
The police.

68
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:22,822
And then Mr. Lomax put the phone down,
and he locked the door.

69
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:25,422
- For what?
- To search her.

70
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:28,719
Detective Milgram said she must've 
hidden the cash in her clothes.

71
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,599
Or maybe she wasn't the thief.

72
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,188
Milgram said he had evidence
that she had the money on her.

73
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:34,453
He told me to pat her down.

74
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:36,124
He touched me all over.

75
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:40,399
I told him this wasn't right,
but... but he kept doing it.

76
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,841
Did he find anything?

77
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,965
No, cause I didn't steal nothing.

78
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,138
Milgram said I had to strip search her.

79
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,779
And you thought that was okay?

80
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:51,444
Well, he said I was acting
as an agent of the police, so it was legal.

81
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:54,875
I put on gloves.

82
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,314
He made me take my clothes off.

83
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,829
And he put his hands on me.

84
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:03,823
Everywhere.

85
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:09,392
I begged him to stop...
But... but he didn't.

86
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,993
I told the Detective she was clean,
but he said I must've missed something.

87
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:15,961
That I should hold her in my office
until he got there to do a proper search.

88
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,478
And it took you guys half an hour.

89
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,926
You strip-searched a teenage girl 
and kept her naked

90
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,006
in your office for 30 minutes?

91
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:27,319
No, Detective Milgram said
she could keep her apron on.

92
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,738
You're an idiot.

93
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:31,630
I resent that, Detective.

94
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,658
After all I've done 
to help the police department?

95
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:39,458
You sexually abused a girl because 
a voice on the phone told you to.

96
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,764
I was just following 
Detective Milgram's orders.

97
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,677
There is no Detective Milgram.

98
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,855
Whole thing was a scam.

99
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,518
Oh, my God.

100
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,487
Just following order.

101
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:58,847
That's the preferred defense of every 
war criminal, from Reichmann to Milosevic.

102
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,019
Dwight's so thick
he got punk'd by a phone call.

103
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,462
- Oh, he's a victim of corporate America. 
- Here we go.

104
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:06,980
You know, the franchise mentality
mandates conformity.

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,141
Employees are lemmings.You don't follow
the manual, bye-bye HappiBurger.

106
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,766
And you say bye-bye to Dwight.
He's looking at three to six.

107
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,631
What about this Detective Milgram?
He's the one who pulled Dwight's strings.

108
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,390
Stanley Milgram?
He's dead.

109
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,583
- You knew him?
- Not personally,

110
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,901
but the real Milgram
was a psychology professor

111
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:25,339
who instructed volunteers to give 
electroshocks to screaming victims.

112
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,050
- Sounds like a nut case.
- Well, the shocks weren't real.

113
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,554
The real nuts were the people
frying their friends

114
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:32,093
because somebody told them to.

115
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:34,088
So what do we have
on this phone freak?

116
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,486
The phone call's a dead end.

117
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:37,221
They used a prepaid card on a payphone

118
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,720
at the public library in Midtown.

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,690
So maybe the library
has surveillance cameras.

120
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,131
Not a chance.
Librarians took on big brother

121
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,499
so wouldn't be able to monitor
what you and I are reading.

122
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:47,784
Trace the guy
who bought the air time.

123
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:48,960
TARU tried.

124
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,106
The card was one of a batch
sold at the Valu-Mart uptown.

125
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:54,244
They can't tell who bought
the individual card.

126
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,345
He's either really lucky or damn good.

127
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,979
Oh, my money's on good.

128
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,559
He's all over the web.
Check out this.

129
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,819
"I hate happiburger.com."

130
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,305
"Un-HappiBurger.
Share your horror story here."

131
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:07,640
All the postings are from ex-employees.

132
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,378
It's the revenge
of the corporate wage slaves.

133
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:11,949
Look at this.

134
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,685
"Beware of the Happihoaxer."

135
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:18,055
He instructs HappiBurger employees
to perform criminal acts

136
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,572
under the guise of a police officer.

137
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:22,748
He's hit fast food chains
all over the country.

138
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:23,943
A lot of them here in New York.

139
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,861
Why haven't we heard of this guy?

140
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,390
I built a database of every hoax.

141
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,039
Your guy's got
some predictable routines.

142
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah, every call came in
on a weekday morning

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,330
between 10:00 and 11:30

144
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,650
After the breakfast rush,
before lunch.

145
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,150
Managers would be less likely
to blow him off when they weren't busy.

146
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,281
Did you dump the phones?

147
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,207
Yeah, he uses a payphone and 
a fresh prepaid calling card every time.

148
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:45,039
But Fin says you can't track 
the phone cards back to the purchaser.

149
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,129
No, but he bought them all
at the same Valu-Mart.

150
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,551
Each card has to be activated
by a cashier after it's sold.

151
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:52,098
And activation is logged 
by the computer.

152
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:53,739
So we know when our guy
was in the store.

153
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:56,063
And Valu-Marts have security
cameras over the doors.

154
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:58,724
I took the tapes, ran them through
facial recognition software

155
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,534
- looking for the same guy.
- You find him?

156
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,741
Yep.
The last six transactions.

157
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,023
Can you cross-reverence with
a credit card to get a name?

158
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,207
I tried.
He must've paid case.

159
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,918
Okay, freeze it.

160
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:12,861
Zoom in on that thing
around his neck.

161
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:16,659
I'll enhance it.

162
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:22,403
The last three letters of his name are 
"o-o-k." He could be "cook."

163
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:24,254
At least we got a company logo.

164
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,474
"Aerodax Labs."

165
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:29,627
AERODAX LABS 
15 EAST 53RD STREET
TUESDAY, APRIL 17

166
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,459
We have several hundred
employees, Detective.

167
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,915
We're only looking for one.

168
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,925
Merritt Rook?

169
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,227
I can't believe he's done anything 
to warrant police attention.

170
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,796
Well, what can you tell us
about him?

171
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:44,906
Well, he's an audio engineer.
He works in the Aerospace division.

172
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,200
He's in the lab.

173
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:50,346
- Dr. Chang, where's Merritt?
- Out sick.

174
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,466
Yesterday too. And we really need him here
to run the high-frequency tests.

175
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,569
Well, we can take a house call.

176
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,186
We'll even bring him chicken soup.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,239
Merritt Rook.

178
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,170
How can I help you?

179
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:08,907
You don't look sick.

180
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:12,446
When is it a crime
to play hooky, Detective?

181
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:13,864
Cuff me now.
Guilty.

182
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,283
We'll get to that soon enough.
May we come in?

183
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:17,598
Oh, certainly.

184
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:24,607
- Have I done something wrong?
- You tell me...Detective Milgram.

185
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:27,531
Detective Milgram?

186
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,039
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

187
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,871
No, we don't. You're the guy who buys
all those phone cards from Valu-Mart.

188
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:33,978
Yes, I do.

189
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:37,000
But I give them to the homeless
so they can call their families.

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,451
I know what it's like to be alone.

191
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,690
Did you use one of those cards
at the midtown library yesterday?

192
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,898
- No. I was out of town.
- Where?

193
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,043
Trout fishing in the Esopus River.

194
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:50,118
Season begins April 1st,
but we've been working every weekend,

195
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:54,022
so I took a little leave 
of absents unauthorized.

196
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:57,125
Yesterday and today 
I was gone, but I'm back.

197
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,924
Please don't tell my boss.

198
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,364
Can anybody verify 
your whereabouts?

199
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:04,466
Wow, if I need an alibi,
this must be serious.

200
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,381
Fishing license.

201
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,198
Hotel bill.

202
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,592
- Do you have any credit card receipts?
- No. I never use credit cards.

203
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:20,078
Credit card companies gouge 
the working man with their interest rates.

204
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,791
I ate every meal at the Daffodil.
Margaretville.

205
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:26,421
Just happen to have this, do you?

206
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,959
There was a waitress there
who was kind of sweet on me.

207
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,955
She wrote her number on the back.

208
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,004
Well, sure, honey, I remember him.

209
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:37,322
Real cute, even in
that silly fishing hat and waders.

210
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:38,977
And he was definitely there on Monday?

211
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,599
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

212
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:43,792
And I don't think he came just for the blue 
plate special, if you know what I mean.

213
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,294
Yeah, thanks.

214
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,990
Well, the alibi checks out so far.

215
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,456
Fish and Wildlife gave him the license
on Monday morning.

216
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,666
So what about the hotel?

217
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,028
They're next.

218
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:54,302
Margaretville Lodge.
How can I help you?

219
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,641
This is Detective Munch of the NYPD.

220
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:00,175
I'd like to confirm if a Merritt Rook 
stayed there on Monday night.

221
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,948
Certainly.
Please hold.

222
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:05,395
Your call is important to us.
Please stay on the line.

223
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:08,032
One of our representatives
will be with you shortly.

224
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:09,263
Where are we?

225
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,870
No, the guy we like was fishing
in the Catskills.

226
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,445
- For what?
- Trout.

227
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:15,353
Couldn't be.

228
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,802
A buddy of mine just went up there.
Couldn't get a permit.

229
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:22,060
EPA put a ban on angling after they found
chemical runoff in the rivers.

230
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,504
Thanks for holding.

231
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,707
Mr. Rook stayed with us
on Sunday and Monday nights.

232
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:27,853
Yeah, thanks.

233
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,349
Listen, I was thinking of going
on a fishing trip myself.

234
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:32,765
How are the trout up there?

235
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,474
They're biting up a storm.

236
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,183
We're in position.

237
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,412
Should be ringing.

238
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:51,128
Margaretville Lodge.
How can I help you?

239
00:10:58,437 --> 00:10:59,835
Please hold.

240
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:04,519
It's stupid, detectives,

241
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,517
to think that I can get away with lying 
to you about the fishing trip.

242
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:08,778
Then why'd you do it?

243
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:13,052
Well, Dr. Chang called me and told me
that you'd been by the lab to see me.

244
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,119
She knew that I'd called in sick.

245
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:16,809
And I didn't want her
to know the truth.

246
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,222
Which is?

247
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,659
I'm ashamed to admit it.

248
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,329
I was with a prostitute.

249
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:25,939
Your hooker have a name?

250
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,093
I didn't want to know it.

251
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:32,576
My wife died three years ago.
I miss her terribly.

252
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:36,248
Sometimes when the pain
gets really bad,

253
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:40,240
I go out and look for someone who 
looks like Juliet, and I bring her home.

254
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,343
You screw whores
in your dead wife's bed.

255
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:43,833
We don't have sex.

256
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,837
We just sleep.

257
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:52,882
It's so comforting to have a warm, 
soft body laying next to me.

258
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:58,626
And if I close my eyes,
for a little while it's like Juliet's back.

259
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,586
So the fake receipts, the business cards,
that little funny voice that you do...

260
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:06,588
this is all to make sure that you 
won't get caught playing house?

261
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,886
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds a little excessive.

262
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,271
I'm not buying your sob story.

263
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,702
I think you get your jollies
calling the HappiBurgers posing as a cop

264
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:17,387
and getting innocent guys
to molest young girls.

265
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:18,814
HappiBurger?

266
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,115
The fast food place?

267
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,066
Don't tell me, you've never even
eaten there in your life, huh?

268
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:25,262
No. Not in 20 years.
I'm a localvore.

269
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:26,794
What the hell's that?

270
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:30,508
It means I only buy organic, 
seasonal foods grown by local farmers.

271
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,989
Agribusiness wants us to buy
shrink-wrapped,

272
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:36,021
pre-ripened tomatoes
flown in from Chili in January.

273
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:39,880
I wait and get my Jersey tomatoes 
ripe in July.

274
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:42,805
- You must hate chain restaurants.
- Don't you?

275
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,590
I mean, all the processed foods
chemical additives,

276
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,312
and the insidious
advertising aimed at toddlers.

277
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:53,483
But obviously you didn't invite me here
to talk about the geopolitics of food, did you?

278
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,400
What do you think?

279
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:59,192
We can hold him
on obstruction for lying.

280
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:02,676
But it's gonna look like sour grapes
unless we can link him to the hoaxes.

281
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:05,378
We could try a voice ID
with a HappiBurger manager.

282
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:08,391
He fooled Munch 
with his cast of characters.

283
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:12,015
Do you really think Merritt Rook
sounds anything like Detective Milgram?

284
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:14,692
What I need is proof
that he made those calls.

285
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,449
- I must be your fairy godmother.
- What'd you find?

286
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,544
Bank surveillance camera
caught a guy going into the public library

287
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:23,924
right before the call to HappiBurger.
Morales cleaned it up.

288
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:29,489
It's not a glamour shot,
but it's a decent likeness.

289
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:31,966
Lock him up.

290
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,556
The people versus Merritt Rook.

291
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:37,073
One count conspiracy to commit 
sexual abuse in the first degree.

292
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,180
Where's the defense counsel?

293
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,808
I don't have a lawyer, Your Honor.
I'd like to represent myself.

294
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:44,264
You know the old adage?

295
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:48,005
Yes, that a man that represents himself
has a fool for a client... I do.

296
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:51,273
But I don't make enough 
money to afford a private attorney

297
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:53,616
and I make too much money
to have a public defender.

298
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,866
So that's how I find myself.

299
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,549
The court can find you a lawyer.

300
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:00,215
Oh, some court-appointed hack.

301
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,749
A mouthpiece who will sleepwalk
through a trial

302
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:05,188
of a client who won't make him rich, 
or he won't have the book rights for.

303
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,036
No, thank you.
Thank you.

304
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,007
Ms, Novak

305
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:12,071
Wants to add lawyer to his repertoire
of impersonation.

306
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,525
- The people have no objection.
- Merci.

307
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,434
Defendant will proceed prose.

308
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:19,934
- Bail.
- $250,000.

309
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,242
Okay.

310
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,324
You're supposed to make 
an argument, Mr. Rook.

311
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,245
Why, Your Honor?
It sounds reasonable.

312
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,802
I thought you were broke.

313
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,178
I can put my apartment up as bond.
It's worth far more than that.

314
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,089
Fine. Adjourned.

315
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,246
I'm really looking forward
to working with you, Casey.

316
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,792
Yeah, should be fun.

317
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:44,936
Will you excuse me?
I have to go post my bail.

318
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,465
TRIAL PART 22
TUESDAY, MAY 22

319
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:54,485
Detective Stabler,
do you have any doubts that I'm guilty?

320
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,638
No.

321
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:59,287
And what qualifies you
to make this assertion?

322
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,249
I've been a detective for 16 years.

323
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:07,711
Have you ever heard of anyone 
strip-searching and fondling a young woman

324
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:10,769
all because a voice on the phone
told him to do so?

325
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,867
Nothing surprises me when it comes to
what a depraved mind can dream up.

326
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,712
Isn't it a more probable explanation

327
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:20,085
that Mr. Lomax had the hots
for this young employee?

328
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,460
So he dreamed up this story
of a cop on the phone

329
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,634
to basically justify him acting out
his own sexual fantasies? Is that possible?

330
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:31,259
We have records proving a call was
made to the HappiBurger at that time

331
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,873
from a phone card you purchased.

332
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:35,306
Which I told you I give out
to the homeless.

333
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:39,684
And isn't it a known fact
that the homeless hang out at the library?

334
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,969
And given the mental stability
of many of the homeless,

335
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:44,470
couldn't it have been one
of them that made this call?

336
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:50,555
We have you on videotape
entering the library to make that call.

337
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,720
Are you sure?

338
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,282
Lieutenant Morales,

339
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:01,292
how do you enhance this image
from the original surveillance tape?

340
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,605
I ran the photo through a number
of computer matrices

341
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:06,135
designed to boost contrast,
eliminate shadow,

342
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,192
and heighten resolution
of the original image.

343
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,596
So your manipulated 
the original image.

344
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,432
Yes, scientifically.

345
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:20,333
So... this is the original image
you manipulated?

346
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:22,123
Yes.

347
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,980
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

348
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,642
I don't know about you, but...

349
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:31,045
I can barely make out 
who that is under that baseball cap.

350
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:36,140
I don't know... it could be me,
or it could be jury number four.

351
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,499
- It's not me.
- Me either.

352
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:42,205
Lieutenant Morales,

353
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,608
how do the computer matrices
that enhance a face work?

354
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,077
The computer uses an algorithm
of the physiology of the human face,

355
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:52,378
- and makes choices.
- By choices you mean guesses?

356
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:55,813
- Educated guesses.
- Right.

357
00:16:55,813 --> 00:17:00,333
So I don't care how smart
your computer is, a guess is not the truth.

358
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,910
I mean, a guess could be you
or you... or you.

359
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:13,942
Or you.

360
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,138
You.

361
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,930
Or you.

362
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,146
I heard what happened in court today.

363
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:33,589
You know, it's shocking to think
how good Merritt Rook would be

364
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:34,909
if he had a law degree.

365
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,706
I understand why people rape 
why they kill.

366
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:41,384
But I don't have a clue why
Merritt Rook play these games.

367
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:42,948
He's manipulative.

368
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:46,275
He gets off on making people
do things they don't want to do.

369
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,605
I went to grade school
with this kid, Doug Papillion.

370
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:54,658
He used to make other kids eat rabbit turds
by telling them they were raisins.

371
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,507
Did he ever fool you?

372
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,581
- No.
- Why not?

373
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,730
Because I would never
put something in my mouth

374
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,925
just because Dougie told me to.
The kid was a sadist.

375
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,043
And where's Doug Papillion now?

376
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:11,664
Last I heard he was selling
used cars in Toledo.

377
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:13,371
Still scamming people.

378
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,151
Sounds like he hasn't changed.

379
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:17,796
Did into Merritt Rook's childhood.

380
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,402
You might find an explanation
for his pathology.

381
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,468
TRIAL PART 22
WEDNESDAY, MAY 23

382
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,145
I'm a scientist.

383
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:31,590
I spend my days in a lab
solving problems.

384
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,382
Creating new technology.

385
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,432
Improving our lives.

386
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:40,483
But I have never been
in trouble with the law in my life.

387
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:43,381
I hate what happened
to that young girl in HappiBurger.

388
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,877
It's deplorable.

389
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,441
And like you, I'm outraged, and I want 
the perpetrator brought to justice.

390
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,296
But it wasn't me.

391
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,486
Thank you, Your Honor.
That's all I have.

392
00:18:57,486 --> 00:19:00,233
Ms. Novak?
You may examine the witness.

393
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:02,266
You've never been in trouble with law?

394
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,476
No.

395
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:09,889
I want you to think carefully
because you are under oath.

396
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,467
Maybe an overdue parking ticket, but...

397
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,528
Have you ever been arrested 
before this case?

398
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,225
Never.

399
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,674
So explain this article to me
from the Hartford Tribune.

400
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:27,630
Merritt Rook, age 13, arrested
for malicious mischief,

401
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,003
trespassing, burglary, and arson.
It says you burned down a house.

402
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,653
I object, Your Honor. I was a minor.

403
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,193
That was expunged from my record.

404
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:37,529
You cannot expunge a newspaper
or their Internet archives.

405
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,521
- This has nothing to do with this trial.
- Malicious mischief.

406
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,970
I'd say it has everything 
to do with this case.

407
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,939
I'll allow it.

408
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,911
So, Mr. Rook,

409
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:51,803
you just lied to this jury when you said 
you'd never been in trouble with the law.

410
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:54,376
- Well, I can explain.
- Oh, I'm sure you can.

411
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:57,800
Where I grew up,
there was this abandoned house.

412
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:01,700
The older boys used it
to get drunk and do drugs.

413
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,432
They also raped a little girl there.
She was 11.

414
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,986
So I broke in.
I set their club house on fire.

415
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:13,369
Hoping that no more
little children would get hurt.

416
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:17,033
If they were committing rape,
why didn't you go to the police?

417
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,508
- I did, but they didn't believe me.
- Why am I not surprised?

418
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:23,102
Maybe because the son 
of the police chief was the ringleader.

419
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:25,053
You know, you can check.

420
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:28,557
And you'll find out that he's serving 
a prison for raping three women.

421
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,301
I had to stop them.
I didn't know what else to do.

422
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,061
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

423
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:50,721
what evidence does Ms. Novak
have against me?

424
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,920
A doctored photograph,

425
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,547
and a phone card that I bought and 
gave away as an act of charity. That's it.

426
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:03,421
Now I don't blame detectives 
Benson and Stabler for arresting me

427
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:06,242
or Ms. Novak for putting me on trial.

428
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:13,144
They're just following orders.
Like sheep following a shepherd.

429
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:16,243
But we're all in danger
of being sheep.

430
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:20,530
Blindly following the herd,
never questioning authority.

431
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,550
It was the great American poet
Wendell Barry who said it best

432
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,709
when he was describing the perils
of bowing at the altar of conformity.

433
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:35,515
Your mind will be punched in a card
and put away in a little drawer.

434
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:38,607
And when they want you
to buy something, they will call you.

435
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:43,807
let you know that they want you to die for profit,
they will let you know.

436
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:48,662
So, friends, each day do something
that won't compute.

437
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:52,820
Ms. Novak will stand up here.

438
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,613
And tell you I'm guilty...
you must convict me.

439
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,588
Don't be a sheep.

440
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,498
Think for yourselves.

441
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:05,153
Find the inner courage to act.

442
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,476
Find me not guilty.

443
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:14,388
Thank you.

444
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,207
That was actually a really pretty speech.

445
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:26,710
And some of you are probably moved 
by it. And I'm not surprised

446
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,197
because Merritt Rook, he's really good 
at convincing people to do things.

447
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:35,821
Merritt Rook burned down a house
when he was kid,

448
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,837
and he claims it has to protect children.

449
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:41,850
And yet he's responsible 
for the molestation

450
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,860
and terrible suffering 
of a teenage girl.

451
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,457
Our evidence proves it.

452
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:51,031
He impersonated a police officer.

453
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:55,973
And right now sitting in court
he's impersonating an innocent man.

454
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,258
You are smart.
Don't be fooled.

455
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:05,335
Merritt Rook is guilty.

456
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:19,333
Has the jury reached a verdict?

457
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,574
We have, Your Honor.

458
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:27,009
On the sole count of the indictment,
the conspiracy to commit sexual abuse,

459
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,841
how do you find the defendant?

460
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:30,842
Not guilty.

461
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,191
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

462
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:35,072
Quiet, Mr. Rook.

463
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:40,862
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you are excused with our thanks.

464
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:44,474
- Great job, Casey. Great job.
- Back off.

465
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,719
Oh, sorry.
May I leave, Your Honor?

466
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,925
You may.

467
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,052
It's been fun.

468
00:23:57,543 --> 00:24:02,202
Merritt Rook's quickly becoming a folk hero
for his anti-authoritarian views.

469
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,402
He joins us now fresh off
his successful self-defense...

470
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,588
Good morning.

471
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,696
Where the hell have you been?

472
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,977
I got up a little late.
I was up all night with the baby.

473
00:24:09,977 --> 00:24:11,494
Colic is a bitch.

474
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:13,489
- You catch morning Joe?
- No.

475
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:16,188
Well, the Captain recorded it.
Merritt Rook's on.

476
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:18,130
You gotta see this.

477
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,790
- Hey, thanks a lot for being with us.
- Great to be here, Joe.

478
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,083
I'm gonna start by asking
the obvious question.

479
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,648
- What's with the sheep?
- You mean Elliot here?

480
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:28,066
You gotta admit, 
Elliot's pretty damn cute.

481
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,980
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Also I have to admit

482
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,047
you've inspired an awful lot of people 
by what you did in court.

483
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:35,443
Well, I believe we should
stop acting like Elliot here

484
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:38,886
and start questioning authority.
I believe this button says it all.

485
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:42,060
No sheep.
I like it.

486
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:43,755
So let me ask you,

487
00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:47,100
what's next for you, your sheep, 
and your social revolution?

488
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,615
Well my supporters
are putting together a rally.

489
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:50,683
Let me guess.

490
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,347
Stop, stop.

491
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:56,340
- This guy can't stop himself.
- So let's go crash his party.

492
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:00,920
BRYANT PARK
FRIDAY, MAY 25

493
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:03,159
Listen up.
Listen up.

494
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,698
We are here to celebrate
the unexpected. / Yeah.

495
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:10,905
- We refuse to conform.
- Yeah.

496
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:13,673
- We embrace chaos.
- Yeah.

497
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:17,146
- We are not sheep.
- No.

498
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:21,197
Pillows?

499
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,034
Is everybody having fun?

500
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,157
Who wants to go back to work?

501
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,276
No.

502
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:33,685
All right, play on.

503
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:37,375
We could arrest Merritt for littering.

504
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,073
Yeah, and give him more attention?

505
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,728
Couple hundred idiots want
to spend their afternoon

506
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,661
having a pillow fight, let them.

507
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:51,271
You got Merritt all wrong.

508
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:52,447
You think he's innocent.

509
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:55,168
No, he made those calls,
but it was never about sex.

510
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:58,678
- What was it about then?
- The danger of obedience.

511
00:25:58,678 --> 00:26:01,382
If you don't question authority,
you lose your humanity.

512
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:03,510
So terrorizing those girls 
at HappiBurger

513
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,930
to push his agenda's okay, huh?

514
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,074
I don't condone what he did,
but I understand where he's coming from.

515
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,975
I'm a child of the 60s.

516
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:12,900
We thought that LSD and free love
was gonna change the world.

517
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,484
I spoke to Merritt today.
He just wants to wake people up.

518
00:26:16,484 --> 00:26:18,058
With pillow fights.

519
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,197
Well we helped end
the Vietnam war with sit-ins.

520
00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:22,650
And what war exactly
is Merritt fighting here?

521
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,695
- The battle against fast foods?
- That's nothing.

522
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,986
You should hear his tirade
against managed care.

523
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,763
So he has a problem with his HMO.
Who doesn't?

524
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:33,551
Olivia, his wife died in childbirth.
And the baby too.

525
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,357
- Was it medical malpractice?
- Well, Merritt thinks so.

526
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:38,116
Then why didn't he sue?

527
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:40,838
I checked during his trial.
He's never filed any lawsuits.

528
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:42,981
A guy who doesn't think twice
about making people suffer

529
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,945
is gonna let the doctor
who killed his family off the hook?

530
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,745
No way.

531
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:52,066
SAINT MARK'S HOSPITAL
263 WEST 58TH STREET
FRIDAY, MAY 25

532
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:56,314
Dr. Slifkin?
Oh... he's dead.

533
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,467
When?

534
00:26:57,467 --> 00:26:59,321
- Couple years ago.
- How did he die?

535
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:02,070
Freaky car accident.
T-boned a semi.

536
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,858
Trailer took off the roof
and the doc's head.

537
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:11,042
I think he had one too many.
But the official word was break failure.

538
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:14,680
Come on over here.

539
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:18,895
Do you remember one
of his patients, a Juliet Rook?

540
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,595
- Oh, that was so sad.
- What happen?

541
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:26,799
18 hours of heavy labor
and her husband insisted on a c-section.

542
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,211
But doctor Slifkin thought
he knew better than a first-time dad.

543
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,732
So he blew Mr. Rook off.

544
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:33,935
Yeah. And then things went bad.

545
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:37,066
Juliet had a placental abruption

546
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:42,269
and Dr. Slifkin missed it.
She bled out and the baby too.

547
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:45,437
- Pretty big mistake.
- Yeah, it was horrible.

548
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:49,916
Mr. Rook lost it.
Said he'd kill Dr. Slifkin.

549
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,485
We had to call security
to escort him out.

550
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:55,075
I gotta run.
Premature labor on the way.

551
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:57,665
Now I know why Merritt
hates authority.

552
00:27:57,665 --> 00:28:00,294
Do you buy that Dr. Slifkin's 
car had break failure?

553
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,529
Merritt's an engineer.
He'd know how to sabotage it.

554
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:05,892
- Unless the doctor was just drunk.
- Crash into a semi?

555
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:08,094
There'd have to be an investigation.

556
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:12,837
I reviewed the autopsy.
Dr. Slifkin's BAC was .04.

557
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,319
That's tipsy but not over the limit.

558
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,817
But his liver was cirrhotic.
Your doc was an alcoholic.

559
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:19,984
So a drink or two
wouldn't have impaired him much.

560
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,804
So what about the car?
Any sign of tampering?

561
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:23,859
Nothing.
The investigation was pretty though.

562
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,831
Even reconstructed the crash.

563
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:29,055
Dr. Slifkin's car approached 
the intersection at 30 miles an hour.

564
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,630
He accelerated to 60
and blew through the stop sign

565
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,601
just as the semi entered
the intersection.

566
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:35,849
Maybe he saw the truck coming
and thought he could beat it.

567
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,598
That's what the police thought.
Ruled it accidental. closed the case.

568
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:41,431
But I see a lot of suspicious MVAs
like this

569
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,680
so I checked with the doctor's 
insurance company.

570
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,278
They never paid out.

571
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,721
- What was the reason?
- Suicide.

572
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:52,287
He left a note for his wife saying 
he was killing himself to spare her.

573
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:57,567
Listen to this,¡± Detective Milgram
won't stop calling me.

574
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,613
He says I'm going to prison for murder.

575
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,296
I never meant to harm that woman 
and her baby. God forgive me."

576
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:05,656
Merritt pushed Slifkin to suicide

577
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,612
Justice for killing his wife and baby.

578
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,990
We dump the Doc's phones.
We tie the calls to Merritt.

579
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,874
That plus a suicide note...
we got him.

580
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:14,398
- Let's go pick him up.
- Oh, he won't be at home.

581
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,808
I'm on his website.

582
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:23,241
"Join us tonight at 10:00
at Grand Central for the most fun yet."

583
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:26,766
9:12.
If we hurry, we can make it.

584
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:30,629
GRAND CENTRAL STATION
FRIDAY, MAY 25

585
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:33,187
Doesn't look like anyones
being disobedient tonight.

586
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:36,495
- See Merritt?
- There's no sign of him.

587
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:39,652
You take the east side.
I'll go west. / Yep.

588
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:48,873
No sheep.
No sheep.

589
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:09,379
Elliot, meet me at the west staircase.

590
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,929
Got it.

591
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:19,514
Merritt Rook, you're under arrest
for the murder of Dr. Francis Slifkin.

592
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:21,762
Only this time, you're not walking away.

593
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,550
I was a sheep.

594
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:29,210
I let him slaughter my wife.

595
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:32,885
That doesn't give you the right
to destroy his life.

596
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,848
Police.
Get out of the way.

597
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:03,986
Police! Search warrant.

598
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:06,729
Clear.

599
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:09,345
Clear.

600
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,516
Place is clear.
No sign of Rook or your detective.

601
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:12,854
All right, where the hell
did he take her.

602
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:16,281
Got these photos off the security cameras
at Grand Central.

603
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,829
She's not resisting.
Why not just take him down?

604
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:21,557
Check out the next one.

605
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,089
She dumped her gun and cell phone.

606
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,973
- Fin's got them.
- Meet him at TARU.

607
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,888
Have him go through Olivia's cell phone
in case there's something on it.

608
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,805
Olivia disarmed herself
and went with his fruitcake.

609
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,311
He must've had a gun on her

610
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,576
she didn't want to risk Merritt
shooting civilians.

611
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:40,294
Merritt have a second home,
some place he could take her?

612
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:41,467
This place is it.

613
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,006
- Well, what about friends, family?
- The guy's a loner.

614
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:46,315
He just keeps to himself
since his wife died.

615
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:48,311
He close with anyone at work?

616
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,217
Dr. Chang.

617
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,045
He was worried she'd find out
he was with a hooker.

618
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:57,830
Why would she care?

619
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:01,903
We both liked to work late
when no one's around to bug us.

620
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:04,254
Have you two ever gone out on a date?

621
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:08,218
A couple of years ago.
One date.

622
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:12,787
He took me to a jazz club
where some friend was playing piano.

623
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:19,168
Halfway through the night he played 
Lush Life and Merritt started sobbing.

624
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:20,328
Why?

625
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:22,292
He didn't say.

626
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:26,864
He just ran out the club
and left me there alone.

627
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:30,131
His friend came up 
after, he said apologized.

628
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:33,562
Said he'd forgot he recorded the song
with Merritt's wife.

629
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:35,869
- Juliet was a singer?
- Yeah.

630
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:39,047
They met when he produced
one of her albums.

631
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:41,645
How did he get from the music business
into Aerospace?

632
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:46,523
He quit after his wife died
and he came to work at Aerodax.

633
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:50,340
Audio engineering's pretty much the same
wherever you do it.

634
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:52,876
Do you know where
he used to work?

635
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:55,555
Tone Down Records in Brooklyn.

636
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,616
Wow, that's very impressive.
I didn't think you'd make it here so quick.

637
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:44,742
Where is she?

638
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,629
I'm unarmed.

639
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,099
Put your hands on your head.

640
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,926
- Yes, sir.
- Stand up.

641
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:53,290
Over there.
Get over there.

642
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,073
- The gun is very persuasive.
- Right, don't move.

643
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,460
- All right, where's my partner?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

644
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:09,280
No more games.

645
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,571
Or what?
You're gonna shoot me?

646
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:13,916
Then I don't think
you'll never find her.

647
00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:29,905
That's better.

648
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:34,603
She's in there.
Let me show you.

649
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,269
Liv.

650
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:42,662
She can't hear you.
Sound proof.

651
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:45,261
Also it has one-way glass.
She can't see you.

652
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:47,318
And that door is wired
with an explosive device,

653
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,405
so if you open it
both are going to hell.

654
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,123
Go ahead if you don't believe me.

655
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,990
Or I could use the detonator.

656
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:13,943
All right, what do you want?
What do you want?

657
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:19,155
Conduct a little experiment,
see how far you'll go to save your partner.

658
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,305
Liv, Elliot's here.

659
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:26,545
Do as he says, El.

660
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,046
Liv, you all right?

661
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,403
Elliot, please just do what he says.

662
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,841
- Liv.
- Shut up.

663
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm in charge now.

664
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:39,265
So sit down and listen.

665
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,591
Sit down!

666
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:57,824
These are the parameters
of the experiment.

667
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,899
Olivia's sitting in a chair.

668
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:04,598
As you can see, it's wired for electricity,
250 volts to be specific,

669
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,396
delivered by this device.

670
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:11,020
Old sparky could give out
2450 volts to fry a convict,

671
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,086
so this won't kill her
but it'll hurt.

672
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:17,175
- The Milgram experiment.
- You've done your homework.

673
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:19,241
Except this time...

674
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:22,095
The shock's for real.

675
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,267
Now press the button.

676
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,724
- I won't do it.
- Then I will.

677
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,278
Stop.

678
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,712
That was two seconds.

679
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,369
If you refuse again,
it goes up to four seconds.

680
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,146
- And I double the voltage.
- Why are you doing this?

681
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:49,694
To teach you a little lesson
about power and authority.

682
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:52,574
You cops with your guns and your badges.
You think you can do anything you want.

683
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,352
- You thing you own the streets.
- I don't abuse my authority.

684
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:58,459
Oh, every cop abuses his authority.

685
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:04,198
Like the ones who didn't believe you
when you were a kid. / Oh, yeah.

686
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:06,285
Yeah, I was too scared
to stand up to them.

687
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:09,142
- You scared of Dr. Slifkin too?
- No.

688
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:11,796
This isn't about authority.
It's not about obedience or sheep.

689
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,390
You just want me to suffer
the way you've suffered.

690
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,350
You have no idea 
what I've suffered.

691
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:20,828
I have no idea
what you've been through.

692
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:25,025
To lose your family.

693
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:29,971
I didn't lose them.
They were taken from me.

694
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,446
I knew something was wrong with Juliet.

695
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:41,173
I told him we gotta get the baby out.

696
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:44,102
And he said everything's 
gonna be okay.

697
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:49,747
Yeah. He was the well-respected doctor.
Who am I to challenge his authority?

698
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:54,356
So I didn't.

699
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,788
I caved in, you know?

700
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:15,265
And I sat there...

701
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,833
And I held my wife's hand,
and I watched her bleed to death.

702
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:25,287
I put my faith in a little guy
in a white coat.

703
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:28,313
And he killed my wife and son.

704
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,807
Push the button.

705
00:38:33,315 --> 00:38:34,575
No.

706
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:43,876
Push the button!

707
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:52,935
I can't do it.

708
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:56,384
No?

709
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,641
Why?

710
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:06,950
Too many people have suffered already.

711
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:16,020
Then you, Elliot Stabler,
are human being.

712
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,290
Congratulations.

713
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:21,878
You're not a sheep like I was.

714
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:26,284
You're a... man.

715
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:28,830
Thank you.

716
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,283
Don't worry about your partner.

717
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,819
The screams are prerecorded.

718
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,784
And this is just garage door opener, Elliot.

719
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:55,243
The door's not wired.

720
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:06,553
He said that he had a bomb.

721
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:09,552
and if I didn't go with him
he would detonate it in Grand central.

722
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,509
It's all a fake.

723
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:14,185
He faked it.

724
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,438
You okay?

725
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,053
Yeah.

726
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:23,229
- Where are you taking me?
- Central booking.

727
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:25,729
May I tie my shoe?

728
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:29,172
- Yeah, sure, go ahead.
- Thank you.

729
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:47,940
Where's Merritt?

730
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:38,526
There's no sign of him.

731
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,980
Merritt's smart.
He blew that building. He had a plan.

732
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,505
He went into that water cuffed.

733
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,309
He's dead.

734
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:12,271
