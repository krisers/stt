1
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,884
In New York City,
there's a fine line between law and chaos.

2
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,803
On that line live Danson and Highsmith.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,476
Tell me again
why I decided to get on this roof.

4
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,855
I think you can chalk that up
to bad life choices.

5
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,164
Get rid of that asshole.

6
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:24,208
- Uh-oh.
- I hate it when you say "uh-oh."

7
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,678
Dude, you put a ding in my hood.

8
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,850
Come on with it, then.

9
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,191
Whoa, hey.

10
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,407
That's trouble.

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,551
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

12
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,855
That's it. I am sick of all this running.

13
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,864
Hang on.

14
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:53,255
You have the right to remain silent.

15
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,383
But I want to hear you scream.

16
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,941
Down on the ground.

17
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,444
Detective. Yeah, yeah. Detective.

18
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,155
One at a time, all right?

19
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,534
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,
New York Observer Online.

20
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:25,579
These suspects were caught
with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

21
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,080
a misdemeanor in some states.

22
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,459
Do you think this arrest was worth
$12 million in property damages?

23
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,837
Why don't we let New York City
answer that question?

24
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,465
The greatest city on Earth, yeah.

25
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,971
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

26
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:46,642
Danson, are the rumors about
you and Kim Kardashian true?

27
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,310
No comment.

28
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,145
But, yes.

29
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,192
Danson and Highsmith,
free hot dogs for life.

30
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,824
No drinks. No drinks.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

31
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,622
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive,
and sex with style. They're rock stars.

32
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,708
Then you got your jokers,
your ball busters, your vets...

33
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,002
... and the other guys.

34
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,676
We know, we know. We know.

35
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,928
All right, all right, all right.
Listen up, listen up.

36
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:26,556
We're having a celebration tonight at Butter.

37
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:29,226
Brody Jenner's going to be there. Bai Ling.

38
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:32,104
- That little short bitch from Jersey Shore.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:35,274
And most of you are on the list.

40
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,276
You're the best.

41
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,319
Guys, I am going to say something right now.

42
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,780
It's about a man who came from Austria
with a dream.

43
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,700
- Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- Let me finish.

44
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,160
He became a champion
and then a movie star, all right?

45
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,413
- Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- God damn it, let me...

46
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:51,415
They ruined the story.
They ruined the story.

47
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,125
Let... What... The point is,

48
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,295
we couldn't do our job if it weren't
for you guys doing all the paperwork,

49
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,672
answering the phones, and all that
stupid shit that we don't like to do.

50
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,757
All the gun fights, all the car chases,

51
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:04,720
all the sex we don't want to have with women,
but we have to,

52
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,473
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

53
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,808
And we'd do it again and again.

54
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,185
Hey, you shut your face.

55
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:13,478
If we want to hear you talk,

56
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:16,440
I will shove my arm up your ass
and work your mouth like a puppet.

57
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,233
You hear me? You hear me?

58
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,694
- Cash bar.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,612
Peace out, bitches.

60
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,950
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

61
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,577
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

62
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,787
All right, right there.

63
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:32,831
Just back up, just like right there.

64
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,542
All right, just one... Just a...

65
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,419
There you go, right there. Right there.

66
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,047
This is their paperwork.
You know they're not going to do it.

67
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:43,342
That's right.
This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.

68
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:47,095
It's thick, ugly,
got Danson's fingerprints all over it.

69
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:48,597
- No offense, Bob.
- That's all right.

70
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,807
- Anyway, now who wants it?
- I do.

71
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,602
All right.
Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case.

72
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,729
- Nice work. Thanks, Allen.
- Thank you, Captain.

73
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,105
"I will do it. I will do it."

74
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,284
Stop humming that song.

75
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,121
- I can hum if I want to.
- No, I know you can.

76
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,456
I am asking you to stop.

77
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,792
- Well, if you're asking, then I will stop.
- Thank you.

78
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,882
Could you not smile like that?

79
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,803
Now you're asking me to mask my emotions
because of how it makes you feel.

80
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,679
That I will not do.

81
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,353
Seriously, stop humming. Okay?

82
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,480
This isn't accounting or wherever the hell

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,900
you and your little pocket calculator
were transferred from.

84
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,945
Forensic accounting, okay.
And it's an important part of the job.

85
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:49,116
Yeah, whatever. Stop being so overtly happy
about doing shit work, you moron.

86
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,076
Hey, guys. Reminder.

87
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,371
The police union picnic's
coming up this weekend.

88
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:59,084
My wife's making her famous
deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.

89
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,544
It's a bad time, Bob.

90
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,672
All right.

91
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,340
Going to get a slice.

92
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,770
You know what I just did?

93
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,148
I just walked out that door,
saw a couple detectives,

94
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,733
and I was about to start bad mouthing you
behind your back,

95
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,027
but I stopped myself,
because my pops taught me

96
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:28,738
that a man who talks
behind somebody's back is a coward.

97
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:30,031
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

98
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,908
Good, because I am going to tell you
directly to your face.

99
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,744
- No. You don't have to.
- No, I don't like you.

100
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,246
I think you're a fake cop.

101
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:40,083
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal?
It sounds feminine.

102
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,919
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

103
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,716
Even if you weren't in my food chain,
I would go out of my way to attack you.

104
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:49,384
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

105
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:52,095
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean
and freaking eat you.

106
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,557
And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

107
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:59,978
Okay, first off,
a lion swimming in the ocean?

108
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,271
Lions don't like water.

109
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,400
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort
of fresh water source, that'd make sense.

110
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,028
But you find yourself in the ocean,
20-foot waves,

111
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,905
I am assuming
it's off the coast of South Africa,

112
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,494
coming up against a full-grown,
800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?

113
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,745
You lose that battle.

114
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:19,748
You lose that battle nine times out of ten.
And guess what?

115
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:24,127
You have wandered into our school of tuna,
and we now have a taste of lion.

116
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:26,630
We have talked to ourselves.
We have communicated.

117
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,881
- Yeah?
- And said, "You know what?

118
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:31,134
"Lion tastes good.
Let's go get some more lion."

119
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,803
We have developed a system
to establish a beachhead

120
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,806
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

121
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:39,059
And we will corner your pride,

122
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,019
- your children, your offspring.
- How you going to do that?

123
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,689
We will construct a series
of breathing apparatus with kelp.

124
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:47,275
We will be able to trap
certain amounts of oxygen.

125
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:51,821
It's not going to be days at a time,
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.

126
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,574
That will give us enough time
to figure out where you live,

127
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:57,744
go back to the sea, get more oxygen,
and then stalk you.

128
00:08:57,744 --> 00:09:01,331
You just lost at your own game.
You're outgunned and outmanned.

129
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,379
Did that go
the way you thought it was going to go?

130
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,630
Nope.

131
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,764
Two minutes before the markets open,

132
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:21,226
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global,
ringing the opening bell.

133
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,770
With Boardman is investment banker,
David Ershon,

134
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,315
who manages 40%
of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.

135
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:30,235
How much did we lose?

136
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,612
You may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.

137
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:34,781
- $32.
- Million?

138
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:37,075
No, billion.

139
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,537
Shit.

140
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,875
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members.
I popped two of them off the draw.

141
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,669
- Bang, bang.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,379
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

143
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,964
Shit, I feel like I am there now.

144
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:53,550
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.

145
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,635
He says, "Let's even the odds."

146
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:00,140
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump.
I send one through his chest.

147
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,726
Game over, bitches.

148
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,521
- All right.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:12,444
Jimmy? Let's talk about
how that story made you feel.

150
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,154
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

151
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,365
I know it's very tempting.

152
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,534
You want to impress your friends.

153
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:22,203
But this is serious stuff
we're dealing with, okay?

154
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:25,707
This is firing your weapon
in the line of duty.

155
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:26,875
Officer Hoitz?

156
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,835
Oh, man.

157
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,086
- Come on.
- Here we go.

158
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:31,546
Would you like to share?

159
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,797
No, I'd rather not.

160
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,550
Officer Hoitz, you have been coming here
for six months now,

161
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,385
and you haven't said a word.

162
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:39,804
This is a safe room, no judgment here.

163
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:40,972
Jerkoff.

164
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,391
That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

165
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,976
I relive it every night.

166
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,271
Bronx, October.

167
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,148
Game 7 of the World Series.

168
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,485
For all the marbles. High pressure,
unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.

169
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,404
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel.
I told him to stop.

170
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area.

171
00:10:58,406 --> 00:10:59,824
Finally pulled my gun.

172
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:01,201
Pulled a deadly weapon.
He started running at me.

173
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,161
Don't make me shoot. I will do it.

174
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,289
Are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?

175
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,501
You dick. I am Derek Jeter. You shot me.

176
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,337
- You cost me 20 grand on that game.
- Douche bag.

177
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,880
Cost the city a championship.

178
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,299
I was being groomed
for a top position in homicide.

179
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,260
Now I am stuck with a desk jockey partner.
Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.

180
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,012
Because you shot Derek Jeter.

181
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,389
He's a biracial angel.

182
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,140
You should have shot A-Rod.

183
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,108
Yo, Paper Bitch.

184
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,151
- What's up, man?
- Hey. Hey, guys.

185
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,945
- Paper Bitch.
- Paper Bitch.

186
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,113
I don't like that, actually.

187
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:39,989
I know you guys think it's fun,
but I don't like that name.

188
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,658
Still working on
the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?

189
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,827
- Shit.
- No, actually, actually, that's...

190
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,286
What is this? That looks stupid.

191
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:48,998
Guys, it's illegal permitting for construction.
Specifically, scaffolding.

192
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,625
Some of the guys were talking.

193
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,503
They were like, "How come you have never
fired your weapon in the office before?"

194
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:54,671
Good point.

195
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,381
I am sorry, I don't follow.

196
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,924
You have never fired your weapon
in the office.

197
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,135
We all have, you know.
It's called a desk pop.

198
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,929
Fellas, look, I know
you don't respect me as a police officer.

199
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,139
- Not true.
- I am not stupid.

200
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,683
I am not going to discharge my firearm
in the office.

201
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,351
Gamble, listen to me.
I will try to make it real clear.

202
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:12,605
We honor the flag, and you crap on it
when you don't shoot your gun in the office.

203
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,774
Jimmy.
When's the last time you had a desk pop?

204
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:16,776
September '08.

205
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,945
- Be a man. Do it.
- Now.

206
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,697
- Please, please, do it.
- Pop one off.

207
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,866
- There you go. Pop it off.
- Don't think, just go.

208
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,492
- Here we go.
- Do it, yes.

209
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,162
He did it.

210
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,122
Hey. Shots fired.

211
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,333
Hey, Terry, I did it. I did my first desk pop.

212
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,419
It's a real thing, right?

213
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,004
- A desk pop?
- Yeah.

214
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,213
No, that's not real.

215
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:41,259
They were so convincing in their argument,
they swung me.

216
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,097
All right, Allen,
you're going to have to hand over your gun.

217
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,307
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:51,394
Captain, you really want to disarm this guy,
take out the batteries in the calculator.

219
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:54,856
All right, I am going to give you this.
This is a dummy gun. I use it for ceremony.

220
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:56,107
There.

221
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,029
You get this back
when I feel you know how to handle it.

222
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,325
Listen, guys.
I am working two jobs. I am working here.

223
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:08,578
And I got another job
at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?

224
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:11,289
I am doing that just to put a kid through NYU

225
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,126
so he can explore his bisexuality
and become a deejay.

226
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:18,671
Now the last thing I need
is a ballistics report in the unit.

227
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,132
I am just going to ask you guys,
please, come on, really.

228
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,967
Just think about... Just be smart.

229
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,957
211 in progress.

230
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:57,126
They're using a wrecking ball
to clean out Castien Jewelry.

231
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:58,628
All right, we got it.

232
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,047
- Good luck, guys. Have a good one.
- Allen, let's go.

233
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:04,008
- No, I got work to do.
- What? This is work.

234
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:07,679
Hey, yo. Danson and Highsmith.
We roll in heavy.

235
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,097
You cream puffs, sit tight.

236
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,515
You got to be shitting me.

237
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,685
You can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?

238
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,854
I am a peacock. You got to let me fly.

239
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,238
Did he just...
Did he just call himself a peacock?

240
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,993
Let's go. Let's go.

241
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,122
Come on, fellas.

242
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,749
Wednesday night is taco night
at Rikers Island.

243
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,223
That's the second one this week.

244
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,602
Hey, you monkeys. Stop.

245
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,395
Let's go.

246
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,314
Yeah.

247
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,065
Heads up.

248
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,525
Shit.

249
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,707
Special Forces zipline.

250
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,084
Cut that line. Cut it. Let's go.

251
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,588
- These guys are pros.
- Let's go.

252
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,048
You thinking what I am thinking, partner?

253
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,758
Aim for the bushes.

254
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,039
Cops still argue to this day
why Danson and Highsmith jumped.

255
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,085
Maybe it was just pride, having survived
so many brushes with death.

256
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,337
Maybe their egos pushed them off.

257
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,131
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.

258
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:11,928
Either way, there was a hole
in New York City, and it needed to be filled.

259
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,305
Two days ago, this city wept.

260
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:18,351
We lost two heroes
who gave everything for us,

261
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:23,356
who paid that ultimate sacrifice
so that we may walk these streets safely.

262
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,858
There wasn't even an awning
in their direction.

263
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,111
- No, I know.
- They just jumped 20 storeys.

264
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:29,529
Doesn't make sense, does it?

265
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,491
I only hope God lets them take their .357s
with them to heaven.

266
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,911
It's our moment, Allen.
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

267
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,081
- We're at a funeral. Show some respect.
- What?

268
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,418
You don't think every other detective here
isn't thinking the same thing?

269
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,297
Allen, listen to me.
Danson and Highsmith are gone.

270
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:51,384
Their desks are empty.
Someone has to fill those seats.

271
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:55,012
That someone is us, okay?
The city's dying for a hero.

272
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,848
- Is it?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:00,560
What about nine million
socially-conscious and unified citizens,

274
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,395
all just stepping up and doing their part?

275
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:04,731
As a little kid, didn't you dress up
and play cops and robbers?

276
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,983
I will tell you what I did as a little kid.

277
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,402
I went to school and made my bed.

278
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:12,113
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

279
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,491
And believe me, there were some
discrepancies, and I was grounded.

280
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,452
What the hell are you?

281
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,496
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

282
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:24,667
Look at these two jamokes, would you?
One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

283
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,673
Have some decorum. We're at a funeral.

284
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:32,967
You want to dance, brolio?

285
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:37,305
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks.
You will be pissing blood out of your ass.

286
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,473
That's horrible.

287
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:39,724
Why don't you step back, man?

288
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,267
You touch him, I swear to God

289
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,186
I am going to beat the shit out of you
with Allen's head.

290
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,813
He's not going to do that. That's hyperbole.
But that's a weird example.

291
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:47,690
- You want to go?
- I want to go.

292
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,485
- Get him off.
- Kick his ass, Martin.

293
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,320
Yeah. How do you like that?

294
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,239
- Pull his hair.
- I love it.

295
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,116
This hurts so good.

296
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,203
- Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- What a lovely hat.

297
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,121
I love your shoes.

298
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,956
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Go, go.

299
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,708
Punish him.

300
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,835
Oh, man.

301
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,463
Do it. That's how we do it in the hood.

302
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:11,589
- Punish him.
- That's not even a move.

303
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,259
I am the winner.
I am the winner, everybody saw it.

304
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,595
What the hell is going on here?

305
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,472
Two good men are dead,

306
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:22,642
and you guys are fighting over
who's going to be the next hotshot?

307
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,851
Is that what's happening?

308
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,520
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

309
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,231
Let me tell you something.

310
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,233
- Sorry for your loss, Lorraine.
- Very sorry.

311
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,652
- Sorry, Lorraine.
- Sorry, Lorraine.

312
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,487
Hi, I am Jimmy.

313
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,365
- Too soon?
- Why'd you say that?

314
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,534
I will tell you something about those guys.

315
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,205
They knew that to become a good cop,
you had to solve cases. Okay?

316
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,251
Okay, and maybe you start
with the Castien robbery.

317
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,920
Okay? So just watch it.

318
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,090
Next time, me, you, library.

319
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,342
- Not even close.
- Come on, guys. Guys, come on.

320
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,011
- You are...
- I am the winner.

321
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,348
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay?
I could have handled that myself.

322
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:06,143
Hey, don't flatter yourself.
It's the partner's code. I had no choice.

323
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,478
Move.

324
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,657
- 9:15, let's have a great day, everybody.
- Cut the shit.

325
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,874
Good morning.

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,044
We have got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.

327
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:34,046
There are large amounts of cocaine
on the scene.

328
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,256
Try to stay out of trouble, boys.

329
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:37,008
There's no chance
you'd want to go on that call, right?

330
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,926
No chance. Too busy.

331
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:43,556
All right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?
We're about to lock shit down.

332
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,641
- That's right.
- You girls stay here and get your type on.

333
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,643
Go get them, guys.
Lot of energy, lot of focus.

334
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:48,853
Shut up.

335
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,188
Allen, could I see you in the hallway
for a second?

336
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,732
I... I am super busy right now, Terry.

337
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,692
No, no, no, I know. This will be real quick.

338
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,652
It's about the construction permits
you were talking about.

339
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:58,738
- The scaffolding violations?
- This is our thing, yeah.

340
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,949
So, what do you got?

341
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:04,535
I got this. I will put one right in your neck.

342
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,703
What are you doing?

343
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,497
Let's go. We're going to that call.

344
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,166
- What is this?
- Shut up.

345
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,585
We're going to the car,
and we're going after this case.

346
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:14,086
- You're not going to shoot me.
- I won't?

347
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,630
- No.
- I shot Jeter.

348
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,882
- That was an accident.
- Was it?

349
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,508
- Now move.
- Okay.

350
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,552
Hey.

351
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:24,847
Does anybody see this?
He's got a gun on me.

352
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:26,724
I am being kidnapped.

353
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,894
Really, we're in a police station
and no one is interested in this?

354
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,521
- So, then what happened?
- What do you think happened?

355
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:35,983
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck,
and I got in my car, and I got out of there.

356
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:37,610
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

357
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,988
I thought I was going to
have to shoot my way out.

358
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,240
What are you going to do, though, you know?
Bar mitzvahs.

359
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,495
What the hell is this?

360
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,289
It's my car. It's a Prius.

361
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,043
I feel like we're literally driving around
in a vagina.

362
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:56,963
Detective Hoitz and Gamble
are on that 518 on East 10th.

363
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,131
Negatory, Martin and Fosse,
two minutes out.

364
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:00,925
We will just see who's there first.

365
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,719
You stay out of our crime scene.
You hear me?

366
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,429
Go, go, go.

367
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,557
You feel that, Allen?
That tingling in your balls?

368
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,518
Big metal butterflies fluttering around
in your stomach?

369
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:12,228
Are you sure
you don't have testicular cancer?

370
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,355
I got something to get you going.

371
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,360
Let's go do some damage.

372
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,029
Nope.

373
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,533
What the hell is that?

374
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,994
LRB. Little River Band.

375
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,663
This music makes me feel like
I am going shopping for a training bra.

376
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,457
You know what?
We go with no music, okay?

377
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:34,667
- Fine.
- Say bye.

378
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,876
No, no, no, don't say bye...

379
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,670
You just signed
your own death warrant, Hoitz.

380
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,965
Allen, punch that accelerator
or I will shoot you in the foot.

381
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,466
America.

382
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,094
Allen. Allen, hit the brake.

383
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,848
Seriously, slow the car down.
We're approaching the crime scene.

384
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,016
Terry, I am coming in.

385
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,934
You're going to smash
right through the tape. Allen.

386
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,686
Dude. What...

387
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,027
That's a lot of cocaine.

388
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,989
Did you yell "America"
when you hit the accelerator?

389
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,866
Nope. No. No.

390
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,910
I have never actually put my foot
all the way down

391
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,914
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

392
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,376
It got me slightly aroused.

393
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,505
Here we go.

394
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,053
Way to put your stamp
on the crime scene, guys.

395
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:29,555
- Prius, huh?
- Yep, yep.

396
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,890
Good mileage?

397
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,349
- Outstanding.
- Yeah.

398
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,019
Did this come with a dental dam?

399
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,646
- No.
- Get it?

400
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,108
My Suburban shit one of these last night.

401
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,818
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.

402
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,571
We have had our fun, huh?

403
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:48,616
Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

404
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,493
All right, everybody.

405
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:53,621
I am going to need you all to back up now.
We're taking over.

406
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,123
"At the crime scene, LOL."

407
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:57,917
- Good tweet, good tweet.
- Yeah, thanks.

408
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:02,046
America has always been defined
by its excess.

409
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,716
The Grand Canyon,
professional sports contracts.

410
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,219
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.

411
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:12,181
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis

412
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,226
and a Subaru station wagon.

413
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,479
And it's because of this excess
that I have flourished.

414
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:22,149
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.

415
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:25,986
Live for excess. It's the American way.

416
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,828
Hello.

417
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,706
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.

418
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,253
Sir David.

419
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:45,923
David. You're not returning my calls,
so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.

420
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,675
- Good day, mate.
- Hey.

421
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,344
Roger and his team are going to babysit you
because I don't trust you,

422
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:51,762
because I think you're going to take off.

423
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,266
Pamela, this is ridiculous.
I am not going anywhere.

424
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,768
David, listen,
the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.

425
00:23:57,768 --> 00:24:00,688
You have until then to give me my money.
I am not reporting any losses, David.

426
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:02,606
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

427
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:05,776
Well, then, you get their money,
make it disappear, and then pay us back.

428
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:09,113
Yes, yes, I will tell him
he doesn't need to keep watching me.

429
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,699
- David.
- Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.

430
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:16,203
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman.
So, you're good to go.

431
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,746
Heard everything, mate.

432
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,123
Ladies and gentlemen,

433
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:23,711
guess who gave me the secrets
to making my first billion dollars.

434
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,089
That man there.

435
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,884
Go. Go.

436
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,969
- Side.
- Step aside, please.

437
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,555
You don't think I am a real cop, do you?

438
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,891
No, I don't. I have said that
directly to your face numerous times.

439
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,058
I was really honest about that.

440
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,644
I am working on a huge case, all right?

441
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,897
Property owner with seven buildings
under construction.

442
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,066
He hasn't applied
for a single scaffolding permit.

443
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:50,154
Now, according to Ask Jeeves, this perp
is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

444
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:53,949
- That's your big case? Scaffolding permits?
- Yeah.

445
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,286
Guess what? You're coming with me.

446
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,955
It's a wooden gun.

447
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,293
That hurts, man.

448
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:10,424
I have always got Little River Band
loaded up here. I have got six disks in here.

449
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,428
Claude, meet me outside,
at the back of the service entrance.

450
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:16,931
I am flying Air Singapore.

451
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,766
- Hey, Douglas. How's the wife?
- She died.

452
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:19,934
Attaboy.

453
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:21,977
I will be there in two minutes exactly.

454
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:25,689
Another thing I hate about you?
You always pay in exact change.

455
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,108
You're just mad
because I have a nice change purse.

456
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,276
Why do you even care?

457
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:32,363
How can I help it? You know what?
You know what's worse?

458
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,448
The way you fart.
Even your farts, they're not manly.

459
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,699
You're being ridiculous.

460
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,369
They sound like a baby blowing out
the candles on a birthday cake.

461
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:39,703
- What?
- Like a little...

462
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,705
- You know what bugs me about you?
- What?

463
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,123
I am pretty sure you have never voted.

464
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:46,543
No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880.
Play of the week.

465
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:48,963
You're like a child in a leather jacket.
That's what you're like.

466
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:50,130
Get out of the way, man.

467
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,049
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

468
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,469
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon,
but I don't bother with the...

469
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:58,806
Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen,
if you don't mind. Thank you.

470
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:02,142
- Excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay?
- What?

471
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:07,147
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can be used...

472
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:09,316
- What's the next part?
- As a floatation device.

473
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,901
As a floatation device.

474
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:14,571
You know what? That's very funny.
I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.

475
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,407
- Really?
- Are you guys for real?

476
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:17,574
Am I being punked?

477
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,994
Detective Allen Gamble.

478
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:23,080
We are in a cocaine-covered car,
and we are bringing in a perp.

479
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,916
- One David Ershon.
- 175 pounds.

480
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,085
- Thank you. 175 pounds.
- Shut up, man, shut up.

481
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:32,089
Martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B
talking to Shepard Smith right now.

482
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:35,009
We arrest this jerkoff
for a scaffolding permit?

483
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:37,261
Wait, wait, wait,
what am I being arrested for?

484
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,263
For scaffolding permit violation...

485
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,107
- I got my insurance card. Somewhere.
- Easy, mate.

486
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,609
- What the hell? You ran right into us.
- Stand over there.

487
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,236
Wood?

488
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,863
What the...

489
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:57,781
- Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate.
- What?

490
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,450
Do not let these men take me.

491
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,369
Hi.

492
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,955
Why's she looking at you like that?

493
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,540
That's my car.

494
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,419
Hey, hey, hey.
We didn't exchange insurance information.

495
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,296
Hey. Excuse me.

496
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,632
Why did they take our shoes?

497
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:19,136
- What the hell just happened?
- Where's my iPhone?

498
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,389
I think we have walked 30 blocks, man.

499
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:27,561
I don't get why we can't just call the office
and have a squad car come pick us up.

500
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:30,147
No. They took our shoes,
our guns, and our car.

501
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,815
There's no way that's going out on the radio.

502
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,319
Look, if we're going to do this together,
there's some issues we need to settle, okay?

503
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,989
I mean, you said I had a weak chin.
You said the way I pee is feminine.

504
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,324
How do you think that makes me feel?

505
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:45,496
I mean, that list you have,
you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.

506
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,831
I hear you.

507
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:52,669
Let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.

508
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:55,339
All right. Fresh start.

509
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,677
Maybe we should call ourselves
the Febreze Brothers,

510
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:02,346
because it's feeling so fresh right now.

511
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,973
Right?

512
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,143
Let's do another fresh start, because
I just wanted to punch you in the face.

513
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,021
Fine, fresh start.

514
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:12,856
It's the last one.

515
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:14,858
I have to be able to express myself
and say things, you know.

516
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,614
- Okay, folks. Everybody, listen up.
- Listen up.

517
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:22,616
Got a high profile kidnapping.

518
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,120
David Ershon, wealthy banker,
multinational team.

519
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,288
Maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.

520
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,793
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes?
because your feet are black.

521
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:34,878
Who cares? It's not important, okay?

522
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:37,506
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

523
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,051
- Bye, guys.
- Bye-bye.

524
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,219
Come on.

525
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,889
Guys, this is Don Beaman,
the attorney for Mr. Ershon.

526
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,058
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

527
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,060
- Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch.
- Hey, hey, hey.

528
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,895
Hey, Terry. Take it easy.

529
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:53,981
- That's the guy who took our guns, Captain.
- And my shoes.

530
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:57,067
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you
identify yourselves as police officers?

531
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,235
What is this?

532
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:00,654
- Allen, tell me. Did you?
- No, we did not.

533
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:04,741
Sorry, gentlemen.
We thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

534
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,493
It's only protocol.

535
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:11,331
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this
scaffolding situation. The case is closed.

536
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:13,917
I have taken care of all necessary paperwork.

537
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:16,086
And you fellas, at this point,
should just be glad that

538
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:19,673
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges
for excessive use of force.

539
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:21,258
- Thank you, Captain.
- You bet.

540
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,343
Australian?

541
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:24,887
Special Forces, right?

542
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,764
Best watch your step, Detective.

543
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:30,601
There are three things I love in this world.

544
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,768
Kylie Minogue,

545
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,106
small dimples just above
a woman's buttocks...

546
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,608
Beautiful features.

547
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,444
...and the fear in a man's eye
who knows I am about to hurt him.

548
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:45,032
Hey. Shake your dicks.
This pissing contest is over.

549
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:46,450
Come on, man.

550
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,122
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

551
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,793
And they returned your weapons.
Here you go, Terry.

552
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,089
Allen, someone was nice enough
to put linseed oil on it,

553
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:04,009
some kind of stain on that,
dark walnut or something.

554
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:06,678
You might want to think about
dropping them a thank you note.

555
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:07,888
Okay.

556
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:09,097
You're mad at us, huh, Gene?

557
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:12,893
First off, don't call me Gene.
I am your captain.

558
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:15,562
Guys, do you remember
the "Be Smart" speech?

559
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:16,772
- Sure.
- All right.

560
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:19,483
Well, what did you do?
What'd you do about it?

561
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,361
The opposite.
We were not smart, Captain Gene.

562
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,404
It's just "Captain."

563
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:27,533
Just "Captain." It's not "Captain Gene."
I don't have a kiddie show.

564
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,284
That sounds creepy, "Captain Gene."

565
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,705
Police mistakenly arrest
investment banker, David Ershon.

566
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:36,708
Was he the victim of financial profiling?

567
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:41,505
Financial profiling? That's crazy.
He broke the law and we arrested him.

568
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:45,676
That wasn't a security team. He said,
"Don't let these people take me."

569
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,178
I mean, when you hear hooves,
you think horses, not zebras.

570
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,265
What about donkeys or deer?

571
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,350
They have hooves.
What about bovine creatures?

572
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,437
Were you just thinking to yourself,
"Fresh start"?

573
00:30:57,437 --> 00:31:00,482
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I could see it.

574
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:02,651
Listen, why don't we just
go over to my place?

575
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,069
We will talk the case down.

576
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,196
We can have a little dinner.
You can meet Sheila.

577
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:08,991
Two cops talking down a case
while eating food, all right?

578
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:10,242
- It's not dinner.
- Fine.

579
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:12,119
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

580
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,580
in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.

581
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,876
She's a big old broad,
and she likes to wield it.

582
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:25,882
Okay, so I put together a little bio,
complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

583
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:29,386
I used Adobe Premiere.
I like to do a little weekend editing.

584
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:33,056
I recently just cut three minutes
out of Goodfellas.

585
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:36,393
David Ershon is currently
the CEO of Ershon Consortium.

586
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:37,561
Who's that talking?

587
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:40,188
It's the Frontline Narration App.
It's only 99 cents.

588
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:44,276
Ershon Consortium, current financial
investments exceed $70 billion.

589
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:47,404
His largest clients include
Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.

590
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:50,198
Lendl Global has those TV ads
where I can't figure out what they do.

591
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:53,368
Yeah, oil, media, health care,
you have probably heard their jingle.

592
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:56,413
Lendl Global, we're in everything

593
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:59,333
David Ershon is often found
in the company of Judge Scalia...

594
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,752
- Yeah.
...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.

595
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,670
I mean, this guy could be
connected to drug cartels,

596
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,590
black market organ sales,
human trafficking, all of it.

597
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,300
How do you get that
from anything I just said?

598
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,177
Hey, guys. Soup's on.

599
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:11,637
What do you mean?

600
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,848
Hi.

601
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,516
- Hi.
- You must be Terry.

602
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:19,811
I am sorry I have been hiding, honey,
but this dinner was tricky.

603
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,940
- Who are you?
- I am Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.

604
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,860
- Come on, seriously. Who is that?
- His old lady.

605
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,446
- Sweetie, it's a workstation.
- Got it.

606
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:33,075
And you come in here,
dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.

607
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,118
I know you're working. I am so sorry.

608
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:37,204
- Come on, seriously.
- Come on, what?

609
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:38,497
Who is that?

610
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:40,624
That's the old...
That's the old ball and chain.

611
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,503
Get over here.

612
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:46,213
- Not... Not right now.
- Okay.

613
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:48,298
Look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?

614
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,133
Come on, are you going to tell me who that is?

615
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,471
- Are you really Allen's wife?
- I know.

616
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:58,016
People are shocked
because he's Episcopalian and I am Catholic,

617
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,143
but somehow it works.

618
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,480
- Are you going to change?
- I already did.

619
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,774
It's no big deal. You look really, really nice.

620
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:09,945
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay?
She looks kind of shitty.

621
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,363
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

622
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:15,992
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App,
you'd probably get a D-.

623
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:18,078
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

624
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:21,665
You know he's designed three of his own?
One of them... Can I tell him?

625
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,167
One of them,
you can take a picture of anybody's face,

626
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:27,045
and it will tell you
what the back of his head looks like.

627
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,630
- Faceback.
- Faceback.

628
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,799
Got some horrible reviews
coming out of the gate.

629
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,300
- It's going to hit.
- It's going to catch.

630
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,428
Why are you with Allen?

631
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:38,390
I mean, that's not what I meant.
I meant, how did you guys meet?

632
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,226
It's a really typical
"how we met" story, Terry.

633
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,644
You're going to be bored by it.

634
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:46,732
I was a dancer for the Knicks while
finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

635
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,817
Allen came into the ER
with poison ivy on his rectum.

636
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:49,901
Yes.

637
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,029
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

638
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,659
We immediately spent the next three days
at the La Quinta Inn,

639
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,704
- and, to be honest, we didn't speak.
- Three days

640
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,373
of not communicating once verbally.

641
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,709
We had actually, without knowing it,

642
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:11,089
developed a language of eye flutters
and non-verbal gestures.

643
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,967
You know, Terry,
it was just this primal connection.

644
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:19,431
After those three days of non-verbal
communication and a whole lot of loving,

645
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,976
I had to go to a specialist
to get my hips realigned.

646
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,980
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

647
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,318
- when they have hip dysplasia.
- Very painful.

648
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,655
It's funny, it's like a scene from that
one movie, always forget the name of it.

649
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:36,907
- With Meg Ryan.
- Yes.

650
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,993
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan
meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.

651
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:42,496
- I will think of it. I will think of it.
- Okay.

652
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,247
So, what about you, Terry?
Do you have a girl?

653
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:46,333
I did, yeah.

654
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,919
We were supposed to get married,
but she backed out. It's complicated.

655
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,421
- Terry shot Derek Jeter.
- Shut up, Allen. This was before.

656
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:52,756
That's okay.

657
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:54,841
She's Got Mail.
That's the name of the movie.

658
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,843
That's it. Honey.

659
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,011
- With Tom Hanks?
- Right.

660
00:34:58,011 --> 00:34:59,179
- And Meg Ryan.
- Meg Ryan.

661
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,347
He didn't have poison ivy up his ass.

662
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,765
- Yes, he did.
- Yes, he did. Yeah.

663
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,058
Way up there.

664
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,144
Well, Terry, can't thank you enough
for coming by. What a...

665
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:07,854
What a wonderful, lovely evening.
Thank you.

666
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:11,566
- It was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.
- It was my pleasure. Thank you.

667
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:16,154
And remember, all I ask of you is,
you don't let him get hurt, Terry.

668
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:18,615
- She tells me that every day before I leave.
- Yep, I do.

669
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,785
I come downstairs and I make him
his fresh-cut strawberries,

670
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,663
and I say, "Listen, my little sugar balls,
whatever you do today,

671
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,039
"you just don't get hurt."

672
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,457
Yeah. Every morning.

673
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,378
And then I show him my breasts,
and I say, "These are waiting for you

674
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:32,587
- "when you get back home."
- Right.

675
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:35,549
You know, Terry, they're not
the biggest breasts he's ever seen,

676
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:38,051
- but, man, are they perky.
- Not by a long shot.

677
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:40,804
- And they are firm, and they are yours.
- You're a nice lady.

678
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,807
Thank you for coming.

679
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:48,144
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble?
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.

680
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:49,312
Go for Hoitz.

681
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:50,939
- We found your red Prius.
- Great.

682
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,108
It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

683
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:55,402
- Come on.
- Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

684
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:56,778
There's going to be fingerprints on that car.

685
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:59,197
Tomorrow, we're going to run those
fingerprints through the system.

686
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:02,951
And if we get a hit, this case is going to
heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.

687
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:05,370
You do one thing
when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.

688
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,538
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sheila.

689
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:07,706
He will bring it.

690
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:09,416
- Good night.
- Good night.

691
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:10,834
Thank you, Sheila.

692
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:14,212
- Bye, Terry.
- Bye, Sheila. I will never forget tonight.

693
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:16,089
- Bye, Terry.
- All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.

694
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:17,257
Bye, Sheila.

695
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:18,842
- Night.
- See you... See you, Terry.

696
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,844
Bye, Sheila.

697
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,392
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry.

698
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:29,060
Bye, Sheila.

699
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,902
Well, here she is. They left her
under an overpass for the night.

700
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:38,653
You find anything?

701
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:41,489
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

702
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,533
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

703
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:46,661
we determined that a bunch of old,
homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.

704
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:48,955
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

705
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,957
You know what that's called
when they do that in there?

706
00:36:50,957 --> 00:36:52,542
That's called a soup kitchen.

707
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,210
It's pretty rough stuff.

708
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,797
Not long after that,
a mama raccoon came along

709
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:59,299
and gave birth on the floor.

710
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,718
Placenta blew out
all over the back window there.

711
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,472
Yeah, and then to top it all off,
some joker comes along

712
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,850
takes himself a nifty little dump
in the driver's seat.

713
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,935
I think he knew you guys were cops,

714
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,813
because this is what I would call
a spite shit.

715
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,690
You were able to determine all of that

716
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,609
- from the hair and fluid samples?
- Oh, yeah.

717
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,861
What about fingerprints?
You find any fingerprints?

718
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,988
- Nope, couldn't get a one.
- Found a cell phone.

719
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,657
Yeah, that's mine.

720
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:25,200
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

721
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,996
No. Believe me, everybody that was
in on this orgy was more than willing.

722
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:32,165
In fact, they even left you a note here.

723
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:35,960
"Thanks for the F-shack.
Love, Dirty Mike and the boys."

724
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,087
Here's something we found.

725
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,798
We found about a dozen
unscratched lottery tickets.

726
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:43,009
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

727
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:46,513
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.
I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.

728
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,308
It's my first brand-new car.
I have never owned a new car.

729
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:52,185
Found a deer vagina.

730
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,230
- What?
- Thought it was human lips at first.

731
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,816
Then we took a closer look.
It was definitely a deer vagina.

732
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,319
Not even a free ticket.

733
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,530
What are we going to do?

734
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,700
We got no fingerprints,
a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

735
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,661
Look at this, there's a two-minute phone call
made after we were jumped.

736
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:11,913
- They used your phone?
- They ghost dialed.

737
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:13,164
Someone probably sat on it.

738
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:16,000
It could have recorded some of their
conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

739
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,460
We got to hear the other side of that call.

740
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,963
Nope, no, it's nothing.

741
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,298
- Nothing? It's the only lead we have.
- It's nothing. It's nothing.

742
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:23,800
Why did you just get super-jumpy?

743
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,969
What?

744
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,012
It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?

745
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,848
What's the matter?
What happened with you guys?

746
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,808
She was just a bit of a handful, that's it.

747
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,732
Allen, it's the only lead we have.

748
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:41,192
We either go with this
or we walk away from this case right now.

749
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,653
Fine. Let's go see her.

750
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,792
Hello, Christinith.

751
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,502
Hello, Allen.

752
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,674
- That's my partner, Terry.
- Hi, Telly.

753
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,261
- Holy shit. Dude.
- Just relax, relax.

754
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:13,433
I waited for you in Tower Records
for four hours.

755
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,352
That was 13 years ago.

756
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:24,360
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.
Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

757
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,280
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

758
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,575
- Hal, just place it down, please.
- All righty.

759
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,619
Okay.

760
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:41,878
I did things in bed with you
that I haven't done with anyone since.

761
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:42,962
No.

762
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,132
- Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.
- Oh, no, he knows all of this.

763
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:48,760
- You're a lucky dog.
- It's true.

764
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,640
Christine, this is a lovely house.

765
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,768
It's Christinith.
Are you stupid, or are you deaf?

766
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,604
Christinith, you idiot.

767
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:04,275
You come to our house,
you get my wife's name right.

768
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,069
- What?
- Christinith.

769
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:08,947
Look, we really appreciate the hospitality.

770
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,407
We'd just love to get the message off
your cell phone.

771
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:15,453
We believe it might give us information
regarding a kidnapping.

772
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:20,959
Okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen,
and I will let you listen to it

773
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:24,587
and everyone else stay here.

774
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,632
- Okay, sweetie.
- Come on.

775
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,847
- There's my phone.
- Great, thank you for...

776
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,645
I hate you, you son of a bitch.

777
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:44,107
- You're so strong.
- I am stronger than you will ever know.

778
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:47,235
I hate you. I hate you.

779
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:50,822
You're so adorable.
Look at your face. Look at your face.

780
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:54,868
You go, "I wuv you."
Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith."

781
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:05,086
You probably think because of the beard
that I am really hairy.

782
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:07,171
But I am not.

783
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,049
Shaved.

784
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,260
- Allen.
- He's fine.

785
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,429
Question.

786
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:16,639
What would you rather be,

787
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,476
a bear or a dog?

788
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:23,563
I don't care.
I want to be......

789
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,525
....a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

790
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,570
because that way, I could live in the house

791
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,781
but I still get to make a doodie
out in the woods.

792
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,742
Allen.

793
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,539
Allen. Allen.

794
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:44,834
- This is police evidence. Terry. Let's go.
- Hey.

795
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:47,462
You get back here
and you make love to my wife.

796
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,088
Allen. Allen.

797
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,468
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.

798
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:55,803
I mean,
that girl Christinith was seriously hot.

799
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:57,513
Your wife is crazy hot.

800
00:41:57,513 --> 00:42:00,642
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick,
she threw you a "Do me" vibe.

801
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,393
What is it with you and hot ladies?

802
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:05,855
First off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.

803
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:10,026
Dude, you're insane.
Your wife is scalding hot.

804
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:12,487
- You want to listen to this message or not?
- Yeah, whatever.

805
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:14,155
You have one job, mate.

806
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:16,240
Find a sucker to invest with you

807
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,284
so you can pay my boss back
the money you lost.

808
00:42:18,284 --> 00:42:19,577
And I don't care who.

809
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:21,996
Right. I actually think I found a sucker...

810
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:24,540
- He's talking to Ershon.
...to invest $32 billion.

811
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,209
Who's got $32 billion to rob?

812
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:28,586
Once I get the money, I will falsify the records

813
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:31,422
to show their massive losses
and then repay your employer.

814
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:35,176
Now, since you're following me,
I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,

815
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:36,844
and after that...

816
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:38,721
I told you it wasn't a security team.

817
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,183
- He was being abducted.
- Obviously, but what kind... Holy...

818
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,810
Nobody leaves our house
without making love to my wife.

819
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,061
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

820
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:46,938
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere.

821
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,856
- Holy shit.
- They chased us 20 miles.

822
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:51,150
- You come back here. You get back here.
- Allen.

823
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,495
2300 Park Avenue.
It's the offices of the lottery.

824
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,331
Holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.

825
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,126
Ershon is using the lottery money
to cover his losses.

826
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:11,045
$32 billion. That's the state's money.

827
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:13,339
Well, what do we tell Mauch?
A guy lost some money.

828
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:16,926
We have a scratchy cell phone message
and an address. It's still half a case.

829
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:20,972
There's got to be some sort of paper trail.
If we can find that, we can track it,

830
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:22,265
then we can go to Mauch.

831
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:27,020
So, I did some more research
on Ershon's accounting firm,

832
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,813
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

833
00:43:28,813 --> 00:43:32,066
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

834
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,194
Hold on, I am up.

835
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,574
"I gave my love to Erin

836
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:44,203
"She promised to be true

837
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,750
"I went to war to come back

838
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,795
"And find five British soldiers

839
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:56,090
"Had their way with her

840
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,636
"It was consensual."

841
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,430
Done?

842
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,475
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm
in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

843
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:08,644
has only one client, David Ershon.

844
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:11,272
Pretty rinky-dink operation
for a guy like that.

845
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:14,067
Looks like we're going to Jersey
to visit an accounting firm.

846
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:16,903
That's a shitty day.

847
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:22,200
And all their fathers were hanged

848
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,745
And the children all got pink eye

849
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:34,670
While their Harry Potter books were burned

850
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,720
Do you have fun singing those songs?
They're really depressing.

851
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,264
I do. They're full of rich history.

852
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,434
Damn it, I am late.
I was supposed to go meet my lady.

853
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:50,895
I thought you said you guys split up.

854
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:53,523
Let's just keep our thing about work, okay?

855
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:55,191
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

856
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:57,276
Hey, get off me, man.

857
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,589
What the hell are you doing?

858
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:21,259
I am dancing, Terry.
What the hell are you doing here?

859
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:23,511
I love you, Francine.

860
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:26,848
If you were with me, you wouldn't be here
in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills.

861
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:31,978
This is a ballet studio, Terry.
Okay? These poles are horizontal.

862
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:34,105
He loves you very much, Francine.

863
00:45:34,105 --> 00:45:36,649
- Who is this guy?
- What are you doing here, Allen?

864
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:38,359
It's the code. I am your partner.

865
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,612
I am here to support a friend
and a work colleague.

866
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:43,197
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

867
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:46,159
Who's this, your new boyfriend?
Great. You got a new boyfriend.

868
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,662
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

869
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:51,539
I know that this is a big surprise,

870
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:54,500
but there are other things in the world
besides being a cop. Okay?

871
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,004
Now, if you will excuse me, I am going to dance.

872
00:45:58,004 --> 00:45:59,881
What, you don't think I can do this shit?

873
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,608
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

874
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,611
- I love you, Francine.
- You don't know what love is.

875
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,654
He loves you very much, Francine.

876
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:25,656
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.

877
00:46:25,656 --> 00:46:27,950
You know what you're doing to me?
You're killing me inside.

878
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,160
And don't eyeball me, man.

879
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,204
You're running around
with this crack-dealing drug addict?

880
00:46:31,204 --> 00:46:32,371
Terry.

881
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:34,165
He does not approve of your behavior.

882
00:46:34,165 --> 00:46:36,209
Can you please go?

883
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:38,586
And you, too,
creepy guy standing in the door?

884
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,925
Let's go, Allen.

885
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,969
I think we all experienced
our own ballet today.

886
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,096
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

887
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,140
You're kind of making things worse.

888
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,569
- You okay?
- Yeah, I am fine.

889
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,573
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.

890
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,910
We used to do those dance moves
to make fun of guys when we were kids,

891
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,411
show them how queer they were, okay?

892
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,291
- You learned to dance like that sarcastically?
- Yeah, I guess.

893
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:20,920
Stay out of my personal life, okay?
The kid flies private.

894
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,173
Stay focused on the case, man.
I will see you in Jersey tomorrow.

895
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,175
All right, Terry.

896
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,304
Hey, that was liberating for me.
I don't know how it felt for you.

897
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,205
Here, check this out.
Article from six months ago.

898
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:57,873
Talking about how the lottery is looking

899
00:47:57,873 --> 00:48:00,710
to invest their $30-billion fund
more aggressively.

900
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:01,961
So he's dealing drugs?

901
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,340
No, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.

902
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,304
Look, I am sorry. I just...

903
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:16,684
I am in a bit of a state today.
Sheila and I got into it last night.

904
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,602
What happened?

905
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,316
She was interested in taking this class
at The Learning Annex, right?

906
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,860
Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?

907
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,821
You know, we just don't have it
in the budget right now.

908
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,407
It's always about her.

909
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,784
Yeah, that's... That's messed up.

910
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,662
Hey, I got you a gift.

911
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:41,250
I just saw something, and I thought of you,
and so, I don't want it to be weird.

912
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,501
I just wanted to be nice.

913
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:43,919
Of course it's weird.

914
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:45,838
It's a grown man
giving another man a present.

915
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,842
There you go. Open it up.

916
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,345
It's okay, you're welcome.

917
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,847
I like to do things like that.

918
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:57,016
Take a look what it says.

919
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,277
You know,
because we're both in law enforcement.

920
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:09,945
We both like women.

921
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:13,074
But I got a weird sense of humor.
I am a sick puppy.

922
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,534
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

923
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:16,911
Me, too.

924
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,501
Real nice. You know, it's all class.

925
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,129
- Okay.
- Don't do that shit any more.

926
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:28,964
Yeah, believe me, I won't.

927
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,634
Do you understand
what's so funny about it, though?

928
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,806
because it's the FBI, right?
It has the same logo, the same shield.

929
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:39,975
And at first glance, you're like,
it's just a mug that says "FBI."

930
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:44,939
But then at second glance,
you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?

931
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:47,191
Get out of town. 
This is outrageous......

932
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:48,609
Shut up.

933
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,290
I am going to climb over
that anger wall of yours

934
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:04,458
one of these days,

935
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,710
and it's going to be glorious.

936
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,925
Shouldn't we tell Mauch that
we're going to check this place out?

937
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:14,635
For what? We're just going to check it out.

938
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:17,138
I know, but it's procedure.

939
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:19,348
Terry answers to no one.

940
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,184
I do what I do.

941
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,688
What accounting firm is closed at 11:00 a.m.
On a Tuesday?

942
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:27,022
This is a shithole.

943
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,781
I love bombs.

944
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:39,034
I can't hear. I can't hear.

945
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,496
There's blood blisters on my hands.

946
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:43,664
Oh, my God.

947
00:50:43,664 --> 00:50:46,041
How do they walk away in movies
without flinching

948
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,835
when it explodes behind them?

949
00:50:47,835 --> 00:50:51,172
There's no way. I call bullshit on that.

950
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,842
When they flew the Millennium Falcon
outside of the Death Star,

951
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:58,929
and it was followed by the explosion,
that was bullshit.

952
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:02,308
Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars.
That was all accurate.

953
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:04,351
I need an MRI.

954
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:08,731
I need an MRI. I have got soft tissue damage.

955
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,233
There's no way
I don't have soft tissue damage.

956
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:12,401
Please stop.

957
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,195
I just want to go somewhere
and breastfeed right now.

958
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:22,745
Fire Department said it was a gas leak,
but no way. That was timed.

959
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,622
They didn't want to kill us,
but they wanted to scare us.

960
00:51:24,622 --> 00:51:27,208
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

961
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,919
I am tired of this. All right?

962
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,546
I am tired of explosions
and people pointing guns at me.

963
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,757
I want to go back to my desk.

964
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:38,344
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes
and messes with your ears.

965
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:40,888
You can't escape it by hiding
at your desk for your whole life.

966
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:43,724
You know what? Yes, you can.
I have done it for years, okay?

967
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:46,727
There's no explosions at my desk.

968
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:51,732
There's no explosions at my home
with my plain wife, in my plain house.

969
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,819
What are you afraid of, man?

970
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:01,450
I am your partner. You can tell me.
What the hell are you hiding from?

971
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,578
I was a sophomore in college.

972
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:10,084
The university I went to
decided they needed to raise tuition.

973
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:17,007
A classmate of mine, Brenda, in an effort
to raise money and stay in school,

974
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:19,051
came up with a nifty plan

975
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:21,595
where she thought she'd date guys
and charge them money.

976
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:23,347
I go on dates all the time,

977
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:25,558
with a whole bunch of,
you know, boys and stuff.

978
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:28,978
And I kind of need somebody to help me out,
like, you know, my partner in crime.

979
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,814
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

980
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:33,482
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

981
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:36,110
- Provide transportation services.
- Yeah, yeah.

982
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,320
- It's going to be a good time.
- Thanks so much for asking me.

983
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,864
She said she needed my help to make sure
that the dates went okay

984
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:44,410
and that the guys paid her.
She said she'd give me a percentage.

985
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,788
- Oh, my God. You were a pimp.
- What? God, no.

986
00:52:47,788 --> 00:52:49,957
No, I was just trying to help a friend.

987
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:52,626
We started making a lot of money.

988
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,505
And wouldn't you know it,
some of Brenda's girlfriends

989
00:52:56,505 --> 00:52:59,300
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

990
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,052
Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies
that I was protecting

991
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:03,762
while they gave me money.

992
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:05,389
That's called a stable of whores.

993
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:11,228
We decided I shouldn't use my real name.
So we came up with the name "Gator."

994
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,938
I am telling you, you were a pimp.

995
00:53:12,938 --> 00:53:15,649
No. Are you even listening to the story?

996
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,529
Anyway, one day,
I wake up and I look in the mirror,

997
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:22,865
and I don't like what I see.

998
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,661
I mean, I had gotten out of control,
and I didn't even realize it.

999
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,831
You can't have a conscience
in the pimp game.

1000
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,292
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1001
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:35,586
Candy and Jolene, said,
"We got to take you in,"

1002
00:53:35,586 --> 00:53:37,963
and they dropped me off
at the emergency room.

1003
00:53:37,963 --> 00:53:39,965
That's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.

1004
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:45,262
I made a promise to myself and to her
that I would never get out of control again.

1005
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,473
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1006
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:50,517
I became an accountant
for the police department.

1007
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,854
The most stable job I could think of.

1008
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,858
An accountant for law and order.

1009
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:04,198
I just don't want to ever feel out of control
like that ever again.

1010
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:06,992
Don't worry. I got your back.

1011
00:54:06,992 --> 00:54:09,495
Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill
and see if he cracks.

1012
00:54:09,495 --> 00:54:13,374
- I am tired of all this tippy-toeing around.
- Okay.

1013
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,418
You can either walk the plank
or take your panties off.

1014
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:18,128
The choice is yours.

1015
00:54:18,128 --> 00:54:22,466
- I want to take my panties off.
- You have made a wise choice, you have.

1016
00:54:22,466 --> 00:54:27,388
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble and the officer
who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1017
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,139
Gentlemen, please.

1018
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:32,518
- Remember us, hotshot?
- Of course I do. Please, sit.

1019
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:34,269
There she blows.

1020
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,942
Two of those Russian waters, please.
No lime wedges, just cucumber.

1021
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:43,153
Guess where we just came from?
An explosion at your accounting office.

1022
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,739
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1023
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:49,743
Gas leak? The only gas leak is the one
coming out of your mouth right now.

1024
00:54:49,743 --> 00:54:54,873
I just thank God
no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.

1025
00:54:54,873 --> 00:54:57,668
I absolutely abhor death.

1026
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:01,422
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber.
The jig is up, okay?

1027
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:03,340
We know that wasn't your security team
that grabbed you.

1028
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,759
And we know you're targeting a big fish
to cover losses.

1029
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:08,178
You talk or I beat you
so it don't show no bruises.

1030
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,306
God, this water is good.
Terry, have you tried the water?

1031
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:12,891
Shut up, Allen.

1032
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:16,270
I assure you,
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1033
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,274
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up
with the whole scaffolding business.

1034
00:55:20,274 --> 00:55:25,779
The cucumber accents the water
in such a way that...

1035
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:31,660
Perhaps by way of apology,
I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1036
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,956
for the Knicks game,
with access to the Ambassador Club.

1037
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:43,130
Come on, Knicks. Come on.
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching.

1038
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,802
Hey. This feels weird sitting here.
It feels like it's a bribe.

1039
00:55:48,802 --> 00:55:53,432
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch,
I saw courtside and I went blind.

1040
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:54,808
Come on.

1041
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,977
Call me.

1042
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,230
- Excuse me.
- That was a trick.

1043
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,690
No more.

1044
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:07,154
Gentlemen, you have a choice.
Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.

1045
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,535
Fantastic. You're so unbelievable.

1046
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,000
Damn it. He did it again.

1047
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,212
- Excuse me.
- No more tickets.

1048
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:25,214
Mr. Ershon,
I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

1049
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:28,550
That's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters
with Mediterranean limes.

1050
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,511
No, no, no. No more water.
We're not here for that.

1051
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:32,638
No, I was very much looking forward
to having a water.

1052
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:37,184
- How great is Jersey Boys?
- It's not great. It's fantastic.

1053
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:40,604
You totally undersold it.
The pageantry, the costumes.

1054
00:56:40,604 --> 00:56:42,314
Wow, what a musical.

1055
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:44,274
Hey. Get over here.

1056
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,568
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

1057
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:48,195
That's not what we're here for.

1058
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,198
We're going to do good cop, bad cop. Okay?

1059
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,493
It's the oldest game in the book for a reason,
it works.

1060
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:55,911
I come strong, then you come in.

1061
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:57,079
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1062
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:59,832
- I come strong, then you come in.
- Right. Got it.

1063
00:56:59,832 --> 00:57:01,875
Now you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1064
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,670
It's just you and me,
and I am going to rip you apart.

1065
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:08,966
How did you cover your losses up?
What drug cartel are you working with now?

1066
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:12,970
- Okay, I will talk to you, you're reasonable.
- No, no, look at me.

1067
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,514
You want to talk to me?
You want to talk to me?

1068
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:19,101
Allen, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Allen.

1069
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,229
I am going to make you eat
a plate of human shit.

1070
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,648
Get away from me.

1071
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,821
Where is he?

1072
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,450
Look, I am really sorry about that.

1073
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,829
I saw how aggressive you were being,
and I thought,

1074
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:42,541
"Wow, I got to go even bigger than that,
since we're doing bad cop, bad cop."

1075
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:47,713
What? No, I said, "Good cop, bad cop."
I am the bad cop, you're the good cop.

1076
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:52,259
Okay, then there it is. That's it.
I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop."

1077
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,971
Well, while you were going crazy,
look what I snagged from his desk.

1078
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:58,140
- Think it's his phone sheet.
- Nice.

1079
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,183
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1080
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,102
That could be the evidence
we need for Mauch.

1081
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,691
- Get back. Colombian drug lords.
- Where are you getting that from?

1082
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:10,694
Jesus.

1083
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:21,955
Can you imagine where you'd be
in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?

1084
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:33,091
- We call this in, right?
- Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

1085
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:35,302
I am sorry, my butterfly.

1086
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,556
We will load them up, send them back to go.

1087
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,610
- Holy shit.
- What?

1088
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,404
What do you mean, what? Where are we?

1089
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,199
We're in the high desert.

1090
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,036
They took my shoes again, man.
What the hell is it with taking shoes?

1091
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:02,663
- They took your wooden gun?
- Yeah.

1092
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,463
- Hello?
- Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.

1093
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:12,965
Captain, it's Allen Gamble.

1094
00:59:12,965 --> 00:59:14,883
Yeah, yeah. Where are you?
What's going on?

1095
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:17,260
Captain, it's a long story,
but I am just going to cut to the chase.

1096
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,304
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1097
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:22,766
We were kidnapped, put on a freight train,
and shipped out here.

1098
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:25,268
Let me just stop you right there.
Don't bullshit me.

1099
00:59:25,268 --> 00:59:26,728
Captain, I am being straight with you.

1100
00:59:26,728 --> 00:59:29,147
Look, we think something's going on, okay?

1101
00:59:29,147 --> 00:59:32,109
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery
to cover his losses.

1102
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:37,614
Wait. How many times
did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?

1103
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,408
Terry, Captain wants to know

1104
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:41,410
how many times
has he asked us to lay off Ershon.

1105
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:42,577
Twice.

1106
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,205
Twice. Terry says twice. I agree.

1107
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:47,374
I am hanging up. I am done.

1108
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:56,216
I got to tell you, I started getting a hand
for that, a taste for that Pai Gow.

1109
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:01,471
Martin and Fosse, super cops,
in three, two...

1110
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:07,436
So, we busted that junkie.
Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.

1111
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,980
Solved the Castien case.

1112
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,858
$74,000? That's all they took?

1113
01:00:12,858 --> 01:00:15,193
There's millions of dollars of diamonds
in that place.

1114
01:00:15,193 --> 01:00:17,446
How about this, Gamble?
How about you shut your face?

1115
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:19,114
All right? Just shut it.

1116
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:20,824
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.

1117
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,038
I know it's off the subject,
but is Kevlar copyrighted?

1118
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:27,414
- Captain?
- Yeah.

1119
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:30,000
- Is it a bad time?
- No, come on. Come on.

1120
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,210
- Not me, right?
- Yeah, and you.

1121
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:36,006
Fellows, I am sure you're familiar with
the venerable DA Radford.

1122
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:37,758
He wanted to come down and pay us a visit.

1123
01:00:37,758 --> 01:00:39,092
Hello, gentlemen.

1124
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,302
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

1125
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:43,764
- You know, I was talking to Gene here.
- He prefers "Captain."

1126
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:47,350
Yes, I was talking to Gene here,
and, you know, it's funny.

1127
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:49,895
I don't know what you two have been up to,

1128
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:53,356
but I have been getting calls
from people I don't ever get calls from.

1129
01:00:53,356 --> 01:00:56,359
In 40 years of enforcing the law,
I have learned one thing.

1130
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,695
When that happens, stop.

1131
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,366
- Gene, how's the family?
- Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.

1132
01:01:03,366 --> 01:01:05,452
- My son's bisexual, so...
- Tremendous.

1133
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,790
Gentlemen, do we understand each other?

1134
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,293
- Cut the crap.
- Will do.

1135
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,049
Guy never comes down here.

1136
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:21,968
Twenty years, I think I have seen that guy
in this building one time.

1137
01:01:21,968 --> 01:01:25,222
- He's a heavyweight cat, that guy.
- He was sitting right here.

1138
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,059
Yeah. I think you missed the point.
Anyway, look.

1139
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:32,562
Blue and white found your firearms down
by the Hudson River. Here you go, Terry.

1140
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,732
You know what?

1141
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,360
I am going to hang on to the wooden gun.

1142
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,320
- To give me back my real gun?
- No.

1143
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,489
because I am going to give you this.

1144
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,368
It's a rape whistle.
You blow that if you run into any trouble

1145
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:49,538
and someone with an actual gun
will come and help you out.

1146
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:55,585
We were abducted, Captain. This shit is real.
Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery.

1147
01:01:55,585 --> 01:02:00,549
Next, I want you guys to hand in all
the evidence you think you have to the SEC.

1148
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:02,467
The financial district's
under their jurisdiction.

1149
01:02:02,467 --> 01:02:05,011
Don't you get it? This case is talking to us.

1150
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:08,223
I am a peacock, Captain.
You got to let me fly on this one.

1151
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:11,184
You know what, Terry? Let's just settle this.
Peacocks don't fly.

1152
01:02:11,184 --> 01:02:14,729
- They fly, they fly a little bit.
- Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1153
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:18,441
One more thing, do me a favor,
don't go chasing waterfalls.

1154
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,695
Was that accidental, or were you trying
to quote TLC on purpose?

1155
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,613
I don't even understand the reference.

1156
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,283
- You don't understand what you said?
- I don't know what that is.

1157
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:27,868
Get out. Go.

1158
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,797
How did they get that story?

1159
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,302
I am tired of being treated like a jerk
for trying to do the right thing.

1160
01:02:45,302 --> 01:02:46,469
Hey, guys.

1161
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:50,724
There's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment
of the pension coming up,

1162
01:02:50,724 --> 01:02:53,685
- so if you just want to come by the old...
- Damn it, Bob.

1163
01:02:53,685 --> 01:02:54,853
Let me ask you something.

1164
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:57,355
What do you even do around here
besides interrupt people?

1165
01:02:57,355 --> 01:03:00,442
Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1166
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:03,361
I make a wicked pot of decaf.

1167
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:06,740
Exactly. You're a worthless piece of shit.

1168
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,287
Probably right, Terry.
That's why I feel so sad all the time.

1169
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,873
I am going to go for a walk.

1170
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:16,207
- Bob.
- Say something.

1171
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:18,209
Come on. Bob.

1172
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:21,212
I didn't mean it, all right? I am upset.

1173
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:44,110
Actually, we don't do that here.
This is an installation art piece.

1174
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,571
- This coffee table?
- Yes. We don't put drinks on it.

1175
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,036
- Five hundred thousand?
- He can read. Congratulations.

1176
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,664
- What?
- I am sorry, are you in the right place?

1177
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:58,041
Or not? I am...

1178
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,418
- Terry.
- Does he... Okay.

1179
01:04:00,418 --> 01:04:03,755
- Well...
- Sorry. Terry. What are you doing here?

1180
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,386
- I want to be with you.
- No, Terry, that's not going to happen.

1181
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,389
You know where you belong.
On top of me in the Poconos.

1182
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,266
Instead, you're here
selling dirty coffee tables?

1183
01:04:15,266 --> 01:04:16,977
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense.

1184
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:19,479
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1185
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:24,067
The chaos of the coffee table?
It represents our fractured egos.

1186
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,528
You think I don't know
about this artsy-fartsy crap?

1187
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:31,366
This coffee table isn't the ego. It represents
our shattered sense of community

1188
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,451
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1189
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,329
Looks like the work of Cindy Sherman
or Frank Stella.

1190
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,289
How did you know that, Terry?

1191
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,166
I took some classes at RISD

1192
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:42,544
so I could make fun of these lame artsy
douches in my neighborhood.

1193
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:45,046
- Terry, lower your voice.
- I don't have to lower my voice.

1194
01:04:45,046 --> 01:04:47,924
- Is this man bothering you?
- Are you actually having sex with this creep?

1195
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,093
Terry, he's gay. Okay?

1196
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,014
He's even wearing a T-shirt that says,
"I am gay".

1197
01:04:54,306 --> 01:04:56,141
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1198
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:57,642
Happy for you, man. Good.

1199
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:59,602
Can you get out of here now?
I am talking to my lady.

1200
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:03,148
Mr. Reger, everything is fine.
Terry is actually leaving now.

1201
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,650
Nice toot, sailor. Jesus.

1202
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,820
Terry, what are you doing?

1203
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:12,699
Look, I waited three years
for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1204
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,284
Just give me one more year.

1205
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,120
Terry, you don't get another year. I am done.

1206
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,663
Fine.

1207
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,333
- Terry, don't touch that. Terry.
- Oh, my God.

1208
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,627
I don't need this shit. I don't need you.

1209
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:27,714
And when you call me, I am not coming back.

1210
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,052
- Oh, boy. Over the top.
- How outre.

1211
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,554
I will burn this bitch down to the ground.

1212
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,183
- Fresh. Energetic.
- I love his rawness.

1213
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,103
Stop critiquing me, okay?
I am a human being. I am not a piece of art.

1214
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,230
- Yes, you are.
- Bravo.

1215
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:47,275
I am a peacock flying into a rainbow.

1216
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:50,028
Yes. Yes.

1217
01:05:59,663 --> 01:06:02,248
These braised short ribs taste
like a dog's asshole.

1218
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:04,042
- Sweetie.
- You know what, I am sitting here thinking,

1219
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:07,295
"Who in the world would slow roast
a dog's asshole

1220
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,339
"and serve it to their husband?"

1221
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:12,842
- You would.
- You are being awful. What's wrong?

1222
01:06:12,842 --> 01:06:17,680
- Captain took us off the case.
- I am sorry.

1223
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:23,353
I told Terry about my dark days in college,
and it brought up some feelings.

1224
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:28,983
Well, honeydick, that was a long time ago.
You're not that same person you were.

1225
01:06:28,983 --> 01:06:32,529
No, you don't get it.
There is a darkness inside of me.

1226
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:35,615
It wants to get out. It wants to walk around.

1227
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:38,827
It wants some walking around money,
and it wants to buy some shoes.

1228
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:43,498
And it wants to walk up with the people
and say, "Hey, Gator don't play no shit."

1229
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,166
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

1230
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:49,337
Gator never been about that,
never been about playing no shit.

1231
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,384
- Sweetie, I am sorry.
- It's okay.

1232
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:58,388
- I just...
- Remember that night we met?

1233
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:03,852
The attending physician told me,
"We got a drugged-out pimp in the back."

1234
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:07,981
And I went back there,
and I pulled open that curtain,

1235
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:09,649
and I saw you.

1236
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,236
You were weak, scared,

1237
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:17,448
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1238
01:07:17,448 --> 01:07:22,704
At that moment, I knew.
"Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry."

1239
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,963
Pimps don't cry

1240
01:07:29,181 --> 01:07:31,706
Pimps don't cry

1241
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:35,008
No, they don't

1242
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,344
They don't shed a tear

1243
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:42,392
Pimps don't cry

1244
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,392
Pimps don't cry

1245
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,561
They never shed a tear

1246
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,861
Come lay with me.
Be safe, and let's make love. Come on.

1247
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:57,363
Every time you say, "Be safe,"
it tears me apart.

1248
01:07:57,363 --> 01:08:00,074
You got to let me be who I am going to be.

1249
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,120
Allen, I am pregnant.

1250
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,372
Whose baby is that?

1251
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:09,918
Who's the man who did that to you?
Gator's bitches better be using jimmies.

1252
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,839
I am sorry. See, that's what I am talking about.

1253
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:16,591
Oh, my God.

1254
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,844
You need to leave.

1255
01:08:19,844 --> 01:08:23,598
Get out. Get out, Allen. Get out.

1256
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,449
Hey.

1257
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,078
Hey. What are you doing here?

1258
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:52,585
Come here when I have lady troubles,
which means I come here about every night.

1259
01:08:52,585 --> 01:08:54,754
What are you doing here?

1260
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,424
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1261
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,594
She threw me out.

1262
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,640
Well, you're not a cop till your wife
throws you out of the house, partner.

1263
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,602
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers
only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1264
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,355
They're junkies. Who cares? I mean...

1265
01:09:12,355 --> 01:09:16,234
I don't know if a junkie can go down
a 20-story zipline, though.

1266
01:09:16,234 --> 01:09:17,360
How you fellas doing?

1267
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:22,073
We're about to have us a little screw party
in this red Prius over here

1268
01:09:22,073 --> 01:09:23,408
if you want to join us.

1269
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:25,576
You're not going
anywhere near that Prius, okay?

1270
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,746
Here's what we're talking about.
We're talking about a bunch of hobos

1271
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:31,124
with fingers in each other's pooper

1272
01:09:31,124 --> 01:09:34,002
in a stranger's car
with talk radio playing really loud.

1273
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,253
It's going to be a nice evening.

1274
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:37,922
Well, we're not participating in that.
We have no interest.

1275
01:09:37,922 --> 01:09:39,215
Let me rephrase it.

1276
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:42,427
We got a jar of old mustard,
and we got a poodle,

1277
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:45,805
and we're just get in there
and we're going to put some D's in some A's.

1278
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,974
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?

1279
01:09:47,974 --> 01:09:50,601
- How do you know who we are?
- You left a note in that car.

1280
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:53,271
- Police, shithead.
- He's a copper. We got to go. Come on.

1281
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:55,189
Hey. Goose it, boys. They're cops.

1282
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:57,400
Rub your dicks on the car
as you're running away.

1283
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,819
You turned my beautiful Prius
into a nightmare.

1284
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:03,614
We are going to have sex in your car.
It will happen again.

1285
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,410
I don't know where I am going to sleep tonight.

1286
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,287
Fortunately, I know
where you're going to be drinking.

1287
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:11,664
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.

1288
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,916
- No, I already have a beer.
- No, no, no, no.

1289
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,586
I am talking about doing
some serious drinking.

1290
01:10:16,586 --> 01:10:18,046
Drinking with Terry Hoitz.

1291
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,763
This sucks, man.
Work our ass off on this case,

1292
01:11:08,763 --> 01:11:10,431
now we got to hand over
all of our evidence?

1293
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:11,766
Yeah, it's not right.

1294
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:13,935
Oh, my God, I am hungover.

1295
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,480
So, you guys are law enforcement?

1296
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,690
Yeah, we're an independent
government agency who,

1297
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,651
along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve,

1298
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:23,945
regulate the stock market
and corporate fraud.

1299
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,864
And the Federal Reserve is a prison?

1300
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,867
No, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank
that sets interest rates

1301
01:11:29,867 --> 01:11:31,369
and loans money to other banks.

1302
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,122
- Is that a wastebasket?
- Yeah, right there.

1303
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,623
Thank you.

1304
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:40,670
- You all right?
- Holy hell.

1305
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,006
I am so sorry.

1306
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,925
I got so drunk last night.

1307
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:49,887
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste
was astronaut food.

1308
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:52,807
Come on in, fellas.

1309
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,060
You got to be kidding me.
You're Ershon's lawyer.

1310
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,895
We're turning over our investigation to you?

1311
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:00,565
Let me assure you there will be
no conflict of interest

1312
01:12:00,565 --> 01:12:02,108
between me and David Ershon.

1313
01:12:02,108 --> 01:12:06,320
And if this were an actual investigation,
I would immediately recuse myself.

1314
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,658
This is all the evidence we have,
and I truly hope you take this seriously.

1315
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:12,034
Yes. Very much so.

1316
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:13,870
From everything I have heard, I understand

1317
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:17,206
you guys are the best
at these types of investigations.

1318
01:12:17,206 --> 01:12:20,042
Outside of Enron and AIG

1319
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,586
and Bernie Madoff,

1320
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:24,922
WorldCom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.

1321
01:12:24,922 --> 01:12:26,883
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.

1322
01:12:26,883 --> 01:12:28,759
- Would you like a seat, or you're fine?
- No, I am good.

1323
01:12:28,759 --> 01:12:30,511
Okay. Let me just assure you fellas,

1324
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,431
David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.

1325
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,933
I am playing squash with him
tonight at the club,

1326
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:37,143
and we're having dinner.

1327
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:39,520
You listen to me,
you Windsor knot-wearing monkey,

1328
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,689
you play squash with Ershon, right?

1329
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:45,026
Your kids go to school with his?
How would you know if he's clean or not?

1330
01:12:45,026 --> 01:12:46,777
I will take a look at your evidence,

1331
01:12:46,777 --> 01:12:48,070
and I will take a second look
at the financials.

1332
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,865
And when I come back and bust your ass,

1333
01:12:50,865 --> 01:12:53,451
we're locking David Ershon
in the Federal Reserve.

1334
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:55,036
He still doesn't understand the concept.

1335
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:17,767
What are you doing?

1336
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,771
We just handed all of our evidence over
to the bad guy's lawyer.

1337
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:24,106
Are you a big man, huh?

1338
01:13:24,106 --> 01:13:25,650
- I am talking to you.
- What?

1339
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,569
You wake up in the morning, you say,
"I am putting on my big boy pants"?

1340
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:29,904
"Look, I am wearing a belt.

1341
01:13:29,904 --> 01:13:32,156
- "I have got big boy pants on."
- No.

1342
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,158
You borrow a little jacket, you go?

1343
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:36,410
You take your lunch
because you got big boy pants on?

1344
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,746
You got your big boy pants and your snack?

1345
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,165
I could say big, loud things.

1346
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,042
I could be demonstrative.

1347
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,294
- Stop.
- We don't, we don't do this.

1348
01:13:45,294 --> 01:13:47,505
You're scaring the shit out of me, man.
Stop it.

1349
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:50,800
Is this how you conduct yourself?
In a democracy?

1350
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,551
What the hell are you doing, man?

1351
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:57,390
I am so tired of you getting angry
and yelling all the time.

1352
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,976
It's exhausting.

1353
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,980
I feel like I am partners with the Hulk.

1354
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,816
You want to know why
I am so angry all the time?

1355
01:14:06,816 --> 01:14:10,278
because the more I try and do right,
the more I screw things up.

1356
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:16,033
We have got a possible jumper
at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.

1357
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:18,369
All units, fire department, en route.

1358
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:20,788
- SEC.
- Beaman's office.

1359
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:22,290
We have to go.

1360
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,250
- But the Captain.
- We have to go, Allen.

1361
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:29,088
All units, I need a respondent.
Possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.

1362
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:42,435
Shit. It's Beaman.

1363
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:46,063
- He's got to know something.
- Wesley.

1364
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,107
Detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.

1365
01:14:48,608 --> 01:14:50,651
I took an online class
at University of Phoenix on negotiating.

1366
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,404
I am going to need a priest and a bullhorn.

1367
01:14:53,404 --> 01:14:55,865
- I got no bullhorn.
- Does anyone have a bullhorn?

1368
01:14:55,865 --> 01:14:58,159
- Bullhorn, anyone?
- Truck.

1369
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,203
Police business.
I need to use your PA system.

1370
01:15:01,203 --> 01:15:02,580
Okay, let me turn it on.

1371
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,293
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?

1372
01:15:07,293 --> 01:15:10,588
It's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...

1373
01:15:10,588 --> 01:15:13,507
Look, there's a lot to live for in this life.

1374
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:18,637
A lot of great things, like soda pop,
big fresh can of soda pop.

1375
01:15:18,637 --> 01:15:20,097
They do not care.

1376
01:15:20,097 --> 01:15:22,475
Give me this. I know how to talk to him.

1377
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:26,228
Listen, we all know you're a scumbag,
and nobody cares about you.

1378
01:15:26,228 --> 01:15:27,646
Rotten piece of shit.

1379
01:15:27,646 --> 01:15:29,690
That's worse than what I was saying.

1380
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,692
I am not going to lie to you, Don.

1381
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:35,529
People down here are starting to murmur
that you don't have the balls to do it.

1382
01:15:35,947 --> 01:15:37,948
- I don't care.
- Yeah.

1383
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,368
I say you can do it.

1384
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:45,164
I mean, I don't want you to jump.
I am just saying you have the capability.

1385
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,832
Look, he's flying.

1386
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:53,798
Stop that.

1387
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,384
Half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.

1388
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:59,512
Look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle.
Make sure you get this, all right?

1389
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,182
Detectives, all your work's done here.
You can go.

1390
01:16:03,182 --> 01:16:04,850
What about Ershon targeting the lottery?

1391
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:09,105
You know why Ershon was calling down
to the lottery offices all those times?

1392
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:11,190
Because he was hooking up
with the Powerball girl,

1393
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,567
the one on TV with all the numbered balls.

1394
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,861
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him
last week.

1395
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,155
It was right there in front of you
the whole time.

1396
01:16:18,155 --> 01:16:20,199
- Can't be.
- You guys are getting transferred.

1397
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:22,410
- What?
- Traffic.

1398
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,619
Yeah, that's right.

1399
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:27,373
You, you're going to walk a beat downtown.
You're going to walk a beat downtown.

1400
01:16:27,373 --> 01:16:29,792
- It's done. No, no. It's done.
- Captain, what are you talking about?

1401
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:31,752
- Save yourselves some gas.
- Captain.

1402
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:33,671
Is there an appeal process we can...

1403
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:36,924
Had to do what you had to do, Captain.

1404
01:16:36,924 --> 01:16:39,218
Wow. That hurt.

1405
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,514
- Excuse me. Where's my car?
- They towed it.

1406
01:16:43,514 --> 01:16:46,058
Couple of homeless people
were messing around in it.

1407
01:16:46,058 --> 01:16:49,854
- That's an official police car.
- Could have fooled me.

1408
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,235
Wow, Mauch was upset, huh?

1409
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,945
Really?

1410
01:16:57,945 --> 01:17:00,406
The only thing I had to be proud of
in my life was being a detective.

1411
01:17:00,406 --> 01:17:03,075
That was all I had. Now it's gone.

1412
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,287
I know. I know. You still got me.

1413
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:09,915
Don't you get it?
I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.

1414
01:17:09,915 --> 01:17:12,251
I told you that scaffolding violation
was dogshit.

1415
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,670
I can't believe you still doubt me
after everything we have seen.

1416
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:19,300
It's a real case, and I am a real cop.
We just got the wrong target for Ershon.

1417
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,635
- You carry a rape whistle.
- This is real cop work.

1418
01:17:21,635 --> 01:17:24,555
There is nothing about you
that makes a man a man, okay?

1419
01:17:24,555 --> 01:17:28,058
You got no gun, no car, no wife,
and now you got no partner.

1420
01:17:28,058 --> 01:17:29,768
Leave me alone.

1421
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,854
A mutt case.

1422
01:17:31,854 --> 01:17:34,482
Terry, I am a cop,
for your information, okay?

1423
01:17:34,482 --> 01:17:36,734
A broken partnership.

1424
01:17:36,734 --> 01:17:37,943
I am a cop.

1425
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:41,697
And getting busted down
to a shitty assignment.

1426
01:17:41,697 --> 01:17:44,909
Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

1427
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,748
But sometimes
when you get your ass kicked,

1428
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,627
that's when you find out what's real...

1429
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,006
... and what needs doing.

1430
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:07,014
Whether it's directing traffic...

1431
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:08,140
Come on.

1432
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:12,102
... or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.

1433
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,616
- Do you work here?
- Yeah, I do.

1434
01:18:25,616 --> 01:18:28,536
The wrecking ball that crashed into Castien
down there.

1435
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:30,204
They also did damage to your office?

1436
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:32,831
Some police officers came by
and sealed it off.

1437
01:18:32,831 --> 01:18:34,250
Do you recall what they looked like?

1438
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:37,044
One of them had an Australian accent.

1439
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:41,382
You don't happen to do any business
for the state lottery, do you?

1440
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:44,843
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1441
01:18:44,843 --> 01:18:46,554
Can I ask what this is about?

1442
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:02,236
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch.

1443
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,706
because that's what a real cop is.

1444
01:19:13,706 --> 01:19:16,292
No, I didn't say "Lock her up."
I never said, "Lock her up."

1445
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:19,169
A guy who does what needs to be done.

1446
01:19:19,169 --> 01:19:23,215
A guy who knows how to use his dark side
for good.

1447
01:19:23,215 --> 01:19:24,925
And then you move to Florida.

1448
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:35,394
One, two, three, attack.

1449
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:39,273
Terry, it's me.

1450
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:41,609
- Tap out. Tap out.
- It's me, Allen.

1451
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,277
Are you tapping out,
or are you hitting me in the face?

1452
01:19:43,277 --> 01:19:45,070
I am tapping you out.

1453
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:48,949
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1454
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:50,492
- They might be watching us.
- Could have killed you.

1455
01:19:50,492 --> 01:19:51,702
- Turn out the lights.
- What?

1456
01:19:51,702 --> 01:19:52,911
- They could be watching us.
- Who?

1457
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,748
I found some big information, okay?

1458
01:19:55,748 --> 01:19:58,959
- About what?
- Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1459
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:02,046
How'd you get in here?
This place is foolproof.

1460
01:20:02,046 --> 01:20:04,590
- We can't be too careful.
- What are you talking about?

1461
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,885
- This place might be bugged.
- There's no bugs in here.

1462
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:15,100
First off, I missed you.

1463
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,978
- What's going on?
- Did you hear what I said?

1464
01:20:17,978 --> 01:20:22,066
- Fine, I kind of missed you, too.
- Thank you.

1465
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:26,445
Okay. I found out whose losses
Ershon has to cover.

1466
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:28,822
- It's Lendl Global.
- What?

1467
01:20:28,822 --> 01:20:31,450
Lendl staged the Castien robbery
as a distraction

1468
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,536
so they could break into
their own accounting firm next door.

1469
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,831
They then altered all the records
to cover the losses

1470
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:40,751
that Ershon had cost them
through all of his bad investments.

1471
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,254
You're not supposed to be doing this.
You're supposed to be walking the beat.

1472
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:46,965
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1473
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:49,468
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1474
01:20:49,468 --> 01:20:52,012
No wonder the captain wanted us
to stay out of this.

1475
01:20:52,012 --> 01:20:54,223
Yeah, I bet
Beaman started asking questions.

1476
01:20:54,223 --> 01:20:56,266
- That's why they killed him.
- Man.

1477
01:20:56,266 --> 01:20:57,518
Here's the other thing.

1478
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:59,645
Tomorrow, there's a massive
business deal going down.

1479
01:20:59,645 --> 01:21:01,188
Ershon's leading it.

1480
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:04,149
I still can't figure out who the poor sucker is
they're making the deal with,

1481
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:05,401
but we got to stop it.

1482
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,152
It's time to let the peacock fly.

1483
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:10,114
I am not going, Allen. I like what I do.

1484
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,616
So do I. We're cops.

1485
01:21:12,616 --> 01:21:17,246
No. I like what I do now.
I like working traffic. It's a great gig.

1486
01:21:17,246 --> 01:21:18,372
What?

1487
01:21:18,998 --> 01:21:22,751
I like working traffic. I am not going with you.

1488
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:25,337
What is this traffic bullshit?

1489
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:32,678
- What are you talking about?
- I am talking about my life.

1490
01:21:32,678 --> 01:21:35,472
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue?
It hums.

1491
01:21:35,472 --> 01:21:39,268
It's Terry's intersection.
And the traffic guys? They're good guys.

1492
01:21:39,268 --> 01:21:42,396
There's this one guy, Phillip?
He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.

1493
01:21:42,396 --> 01:21:43,647
You have got to see it, Allen. You have got to.

1494
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:46,358
What happened to you?
What happened to this being our time?

1495
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,861
No way, Allen. I am out. I am done.

1496
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,990
- Get in the car.
- Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.

1497
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:58,328
- Apartment pop. Now get in the car.
- You're not going to shoot me.

1498
01:21:58,328 --> 01:22:00,998
Okay, I will be honest. This is only
the second time I have ever fired this.

1499
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:02,374
So stop pointing it at me.

1500
01:22:02,374 --> 01:22:06,545
Look, tomorrow morning,
all I know is I am going to Mauch, all right?

1501
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:07,921
For what? He doesn't care.

1502
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:11,175
He's been dodging this case for too long
and I want answers.

1503
01:22:11,175 --> 01:22:13,510
I want him to look me in the eye
and tell me why.

1504
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,388
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1505
01:22:17,056 --> 01:22:18,432
I hope I am not alone.

1506
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,769
Hope you bring it.

1507
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,606
We got a big day out there. Big one.

1508
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:28,233
We got a full moon.
People are going to be amped, all right?

1509
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:31,069
Let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?

1510
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,739
The new bathmats are in.

1511
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:40,746
One more thing.
We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.

1512
01:22:40,746 --> 01:22:44,333
Jeez, I am sorry. That's from my other job.
Ignore that. Forget that.

1513
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:45,584
Well, don't ignore it.

1514
01:22:45,584 --> 01:22:48,879
If you live in Crown Heights,
you know, walk in pairs.

1515
01:22:48,879 --> 01:22:53,300
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.

1516
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:57,054
I got to go. Go get them.
Let's be careful out there.

1517
01:22:59,098 --> 01:23:00,224
The oak.

1518
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,852
I like to keep the oak together
and the maple separately, okay?

1519
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:05,062
And these chopping boards?

1520
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:06,396
Hey, Captain.

1521
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,317
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1522
01:23:10,317 --> 01:23:12,236
What are you doing here?
Are you here for the bathmats?

1523
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:16,365
- I need you to be straight with me.
- Straight with us.

1524
01:23:16,365 --> 01:23:19,159
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1525
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:22,955
- I thought you were working traffic today.
- Let them block the box.

1526
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,792
- Besides, partners' code, right?
- Thanks.

1527
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,963
Hey, why have you worked your ass off
trying to kill this case?

1528
01:23:32,423 --> 01:23:35,467
All right, fine.
I am going to tell you guys something.

1529
01:23:35,467 --> 01:23:38,846
You really went into deep water on this one.
You really went in deep.

1530
01:23:38,846 --> 01:23:40,889
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups,

1531
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:43,851
and I got to save
what little ass I have left, okay?

1532
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:46,645
You keep hiding from shit in the world,

1533
01:23:46,645 --> 01:23:48,981
and eventually the world
comes to your front door.

1534
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,692
- Nice.
- That's very nice.

1535
01:23:51,692 --> 01:23:53,360
I heard it in an episode
of Touched By An Angel.

1536
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:57,906
You keep this thing real quiet,
and you make sure you have real evidence,

1537
01:23:57,906 --> 01:23:59,575
and maybe I will see what I can do.

1538
01:23:59,575 --> 01:24:00,868
But if you make a lot of noise

1539
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:04,121
and you attract the media attention,
and you bring the DA in on this,

1540
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:05,789
I am out, okay?

1541
01:24:05,789 --> 01:24:07,165
Yeah, we will go in there like church mice.

1542
01:24:07,165 --> 01:24:11,628
But there's one case,
one case in a career where you go all in.

1543
01:24:11,628 --> 01:24:12,838
This is it.

1544
01:24:13,464 --> 01:24:16,800
All right. Then you do us proud.

1545
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,552
because I don't want no scrubs.

1546
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,805
- Really?
- No.

1547
01:24:21,805 --> 01:24:25,225
- You're not aware that's a TLC song?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

1548
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:26,894
- Second time.
- You said chasing waterfalls,

1549
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:28,145
now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.

1550
01:24:28,145 --> 01:24:30,022
- I don't even understand the reference.
- It's like a tic.

1551
01:24:30,022 --> 01:24:31,231
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1552
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:33,650
Remember, this thing gets messy,
we never talked.

1553
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,736
- You can trust us.
- Real quiet.

1554
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:38,155
You got to creep. Creep.

1555
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:39,698
Come on.

1556
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:43,160
You don't say "Creep-creep"
unless you're quoting TLC.

1557
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,745
Hey, guys.

1558
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,581
You know Danson and Highsmith
were not good cops, right?

1559
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,042
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that,
but it's a drag.

1560
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:52,044
I mean, at a certain point,
who's left to be a hero?

1561
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:55,547
Not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.

1562
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:58,508
You ready?

1563
01:24:58,508 --> 01:25:00,260
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1564
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,146
- No, but the highlights are great.
- Thank you.

1565
01:25:11,146 --> 01:25:13,315
- Sexy but serious.
- Thank you.

1566
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:14,775
Excuse me.

1567
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,445
Who the hell are all these people?
I was only expecting one man.

1568
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:23,033
You know, they're just some people
I owe money to who wanted to be here.

1569
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:24,242
Who are they?

1570
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:30,415
Well, they are some Chechen patriots,
entrepreneurs.

1571
01:25:30,415 --> 01:25:36,338
And the black chaps
are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1572
01:25:36,338 --> 01:25:38,632
You owe money
to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1573
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,217
Yes. Yes, I do.

1574
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:43,470
- You're a piece of work.
- Thank you.

1575
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:47,057
Probably best to get started.

1576
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:50,894
This is good, baby.
We're in the game, we know the score.

1577
01:25:50,894 --> 01:25:53,897
The only thing that bugs me is
we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.

1578
01:25:53,897 --> 01:25:58,068
- Is it the lotto? Who is it?
- Who cares? Some rich prick.

1579
01:25:58,068 --> 01:26:04,116
I have to tell you,
I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1580
01:26:04,116 --> 01:26:06,660
And I can assure you
that every dime of your money

1581
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,788
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

1582
01:26:09,788 --> 01:26:11,832
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1583
01:26:11,832 --> 01:26:13,458
We think our members
are going to be just thrilled.

1584
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:17,421
Yeah. I mean, we have averaged,
like, 18% over the last 10 years.

1585
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:20,674
All right.
Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1586
01:26:20,674 --> 01:26:23,010
I can feel that tingling in my balls
you were talking about.

1587
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,177
Beautiful.

1588
01:26:24,177 --> 01:26:25,679
All right, listen up.

1589
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,682
I am Detective Gamble.
This is Detective Hoitz.

1590
01:26:28,682 --> 01:26:30,934
We need your cooperation.

1591
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:32,477
David Ershon.

1592
01:26:32,477 --> 01:26:34,896
You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,

1593
01:26:34,896 --> 01:26:36,690
and in connection
to the murder of Don Beaman.

1594
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:38,650
This is a bad idea.

1595
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,485
Hey, guys.

1596
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:44,531
Bob? What are you doing here?

1597
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,324
I am investing.

1598
01:26:46,324 --> 01:26:48,827
Do you remember we talked about
that proxy vote a while back?

1599
01:26:48,827 --> 01:26:50,537
- This is what it was for.
- Holy shit.

1600
01:26:50,537 --> 01:26:53,165
It's a more aggressive investment strategy
for the pension.

1601
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:57,502
Allen. We're the suckers.
They're targeting the police pension fund.

1602
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:07,471
Gentlemen, you're here illegally
and without a warrant.

1603
01:27:08,347 --> 01:27:09,848
We are within our rights to take action.

1604
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,158
So much for quiet as church mice.

1605
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:11,701
Go.

1606
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:18,208
Who the hell are those guys?

1607
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:21,336
Gentlemen, I can get you
obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.

1608
01:28:21,336 --> 01:28:25,382
Even I admit that's not very tempting,
but I am not made of tickets, God damn it.

1609
01:28:25,382 --> 01:28:27,425
- Get in the front.
- How do you start this freaking thing?

1610
01:28:27,718 --> 01:28:28,718
Go on. Go.

1611
01:28:29,428 --> 01:28:30,428
- Shit.
- Go.

1612
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:33,890
Oh, my...

1613
01:28:35,309 --> 01:28:38,186
Jeanie. Get over here.
You, go get the bloody car.

1614
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:25,775
Hold the wheel.

1615
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,825
- Open the back.
- I got it. I got it.

1616
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:44,711
They're going to kill me.
And then they will kill you.

1617
01:29:44,711 --> 01:29:47,213
- Well, I am going to kill you first.
- And then they will kill me.

1618
01:29:47,213 --> 01:29:50,383
We have two rogue police officers.
They are armed and dangerous,

1619
01:29:50,383 --> 01:29:52,135
- and holding David Ershon hostage.
- Stupid pricks.

1620
01:29:52,135 --> 01:29:55,722
- It's us, we're good guys.
- Exactly. They're the good guys.

1621
01:29:55,722 --> 01:29:57,974
Where do we go? Where do we go?

1622
01:29:57,974 --> 01:30:00,727
I have a small apartment.
No one knows about it.

1623
01:30:00,727 --> 01:30:03,480
I use it mainly for my parents
and prostitutes.

1624
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,690
Not at the same time. That would be wrong.

1625
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,988
Let's hear it from the top, every detail.

1626
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:16,910
I think the best way to tell the story
is by starting at the end, briefly,

1627
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:21,998
then going back to the beginning,
and then periodically returning to the end,

1628
01:30:21,998 --> 01:30:25,168
maybe giving different characters'
perspectives throughout.

1629
01:30:25,168 --> 01:30:28,505
Just to give it a bit of dynamism,
otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.

1630
01:30:28,505 --> 01:30:29,756
Just tell us what happened.

1631
01:30:29,756 --> 01:30:32,592
I lost a bunch of money from some people
and now they want it back.

1632
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,260
What about Don Beaman?

1633
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,846
Beaman knew
that I had falsified my financials,

1634
01:30:36,846 --> 01:30:39,849
so they sent down Wesley
to try and keep him quiet.

1635
01:30:39,849 --> 01:30:41,768
He forced him at gunpoint
to drink a bunch of gin

1636
01:30:41,768 --> 01:30:43,937
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1637
01:30:43,937 --> 01:30:45,689
It was only a matter of time before he fell.

1638
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:49,192
At least we stopped you
from getting the pension fund.

1639
01:30:49,192 --> 01:30:52,529
Well, but, yeah, but you didn't.
It's already in my account.

1640
01:30:52,529 --> 01:30:55,198
By 9:00 in the morning,
it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1641
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:58,034
and from there it's transferred
to a dozen offshore accounts.

1642
01:30:58,034 --> 01:30:59,619
By 9:01, it's gone.

1643
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:02,706
- Well, what if we stop the transfer?
- But you can't. I mean, there's a...

1644
01:31:02,706 --> 01:31:05,291
What if we stop the transfer?

1645
01:31:05,291 --> 01:31:08,211
You'd have to be at Endemic Bank
for 9:00 exactly,

1646
01:31:08,211 --> 01:31:10,797
find the clerk,
get the routing number.

1647
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:11,881
We got to stop it.

1648
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:13,216
There's no way.

1649
01:31:13,216 --> 01:31:16,886
Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew,
they will all be after us.

1650
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:21,099
You could let me go,
and I will give you $10 million each.

1651
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:24,728
- It's not a bribe.
- Of course it's a bribe.

1652
01:31:24,728 --> 01:31:26,980
You're offering to pay us money
to not do our job.

1653
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:30,316
It's not a bribe.

1654
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:33,319
We hang low here tonight.
Nobody knows about this place.

1655
01:31:33,319 --> 01:31:35,155
We will be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.

1656
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:37,490
First things first, I got to go see Sheila.

1657
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,950
No way, it's too dangerous.

1658
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:41,327
Look, Terry, we don't know
what's going to happen to us tomorrow,

1659
01:31:41,327 --> 01:31:44,998
but tonight,
I need to make things right with Sheila.

1660
01:31:45,499 --> 01:31:47,417
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1661
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,502
Thanks, I will.

1662
01:31:50,337 --> 01:31:51,588
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1663
01:31:51,588 --> 01:31:53,506
- Okay.
- Okay.

1664
01:31:53,506 --> 01:31:56,509
Tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.

1665
01:31:56,509 --> 01:31:58,094
He wants to make sure you know

1666
01:31:58,094 --> 01:32:00,513
that he will be there for you
if anything happens.

1667
01:32:00,513 --> 01:32:02,682
- Yeah.
- Drop of a hat, I am there.

1668
01:32:02,933 --> 01:32:04,934
Look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.

1669
01:32:04,934 --> 01:32:07,937
If something happens to you,
I need to be there to take care of her.

1670
01:32:07,937 --> 01:32:10,940
All of her wants, her needs,
and desires are now my responsibility.

1671
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:13,193
Why do you say it
like it's a predetermined thing?

1672
01:32:13,193 --> 01:32:14,778
Just go, man.

1673
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,988
Okay. Thanks.

1674
01:32:17,948 --> 01:32:19,032
Go.

1675
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:24,162
Janeco Gallery.

1676
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:27,207
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.

1677
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,052
Please pick up.

1678
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:41,137
Hello.

1679
01:32:41,137 --> 01:32:44,390
Hey, sweetie.
I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.

1680
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:47,727
You know what, I can't talk any more.
I think the phone's being tapped.

1681
01:32:47,978 --> 01:32:50,480
Baby, where are you? I want to see you.

1682
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,732
I am near the place where we did it
three Halloweens ago.

1683
01:32:52,732 --> 01:32:53,858
Do you remember?

1684
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,152
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1685
01:32:56,152 --> 01:32:59,906
I am just warning you, though. Watch out.
I think they're watching the house.

1686
01:32:59,906 --> 01:33:02,575
Don't worry, sweetie.
I think I have a way of talking to you.

1687
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:07,038
I have to admit, I wasn't going to come.
I mean...

1688
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:11,668
After all those years,
after the restraining order.

1689
01:33:11,668 --> 01:33:15,088
I was worried I might not see you again.

1690
01:33:15,088 --> 01:33:16,840
There's some
very dangerous people after him,

1691
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,924
and now they're after us.

1692
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:22,762
It's just the old lady.

1693
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:29,519
Hello, Allen.

1694
01:33:29,519 --> 01:33:32,188
Hello, Mama Ramos.
What are you doing out here?

1695
01:33:32,188 --> 01:33:36,609
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened
and she wants you back.

1696
01:33:36,609 --> 01:33:38,528
- She also says...
- Yes.

1697
01:33:38,528 --> 01:33:42,448
...she wants you on top of her,
holding her hair,

1698
01:33:42,448 --> 01:33:44,617
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1699
01:33:45,244 --> 01:33:48,872
while she sucks your thumb and says,
"Mommy likey."

1700
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,124
You, you tell your daughter...

1701
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:54,127
He said he will always love you.

1702
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:56,880
And he's so happy
that you're having his child.

1703
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,131
Allen.

1704
01:33:58,131 --> 01:34:00,049
He also says that

1705
01:34:00,049 --> 01:34:04,179
he wants you to stare into each other's eyes
without blinking while you do it.

1706
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:07,307
- I love when we do that, Mom.
- And then afterward,

1707
01:34:07,307 --> 01:34:09,392
lick the sex off each other.

1708
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:13,146
I don't want to do this.

1709
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:17,942
- You say things that are too personal.
- Okay, but just one more thing.

1710
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:20,195
She said she loves you,

1711
01:34:20,195 --> 01:34:23,406
and wants to hold your hand
and have iced tea with you.

1712
01:34:24,074 --> 01:34:26,576
Come on. That's not all she said.

1713
01:34:27,077 --> 01:34:28,244
No.

1714
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:32,916
- She says other things, but I don't want...
- Please, please, please.

1715
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:35,251
You don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.

1716
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:36,920
Okay.

1717
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:44,344
She says she wants to unplug all the clocks
and the phones

1718
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:47,639
- and have a three-day F marathon.
- That's more like it. Yeah.

1719
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:53,061
She wants to walk wrong for a week
because you guys F'd so hard.

1720
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:54,354
That's just lovely.

1721
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:58,358
No more. He says things I can't say.

1722
01:34:58,358 --> 01:35:04,238
It involves a mannequin hand
and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1723
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:13,957
Now what'd she say?

1724
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,127
She says she loves you.

1725
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,719
I am so sorry about everything.

1726
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:32,058
And I just had to come here tonight
to tell you that I love you.

1727
01:35:32,058 --> 01:35:35,979
And the reason why I act like
you're a plain wife is that

1728
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:41,734
I am afraid that if I admit to how stunning

1729
01:35:41,734 --> 01:35:44,612
and intelligent and wonderful you are,

1730
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:49,325
- I'd just lose you.
- Shut up, Allen. I love you.

1731
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:52,620
We have a place that's safe. All right.

1732
01:36:05,175 --> 01:36:06,426
I am going to break your hip.

1733
01:36:15,185 --> 01:36:17,478
I am about to do you grandpa-style.

1734
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,537
I brought some music.

1735
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,044
Not what I would have chosen, but screw it.

1736
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:44,380
All right. Let's go, Monday morning,
time to go to work.

1737
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,548
Let's do it.

1738
01:36:45,548 --> 01:36:47,383
- You want my gate code?
- Shut up, man.

1739
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:56,059
That's Wesley.

1740
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,196
Yes.

1741
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:13,159
- Where'd you learn to drive like that?
- Grand Theft Auto.

1742
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,330
Shit, Allen, they're coming.

1743
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:22,752
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

1744
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:25,755
- Do something, Allen.
- Hold on, hold on.

1745
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:49,112
Someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.

1746
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,115
I did that.

1747
01:37:52,115 --> 01:37:53,866
- I did that.
- Oh, my God.

1748
01:37:53,866 --> 01:37:56,285
- That's what I am talking about.
- We jack-knifed them.

1749
01:37:56,285 --> 01:37:58,871
Did you see that? It went backwards
and then turned upside-down.

1750
01:37:58,871 --> 01:38:02,542
Gator turns vans upside-down like
they're in a crazy washing machine.

1751
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:04,669
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1752
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:07,880
It's a nickname I had in college.
I used to run a dating service.

1753
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,175
- He was a pimp.
- Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.

1754
01:38:11,175 --> 01:38:13,803
Is it me or does it smell
like deer vagina in here?

1755
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:15,972
My poor car.

1756
01:38:16,306 --> 01:38:18,766
Right now the streets are a bloodbath.

1757
01:38:18,766 --> 01:38:21,978
And, statistically speaking,
there's about 30 kids in here,

1758
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:24,063
10 of you are going to be dead
before your next birthday.

1759
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:27,441
Got a couple of tips,
help you guys stay out of jail.

1760
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:31,779
One, try your hardest
to not be black or Hispanic.

1761
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:34,115
- It's a good tip.
- Yeah. Two...

1762
01:38:34,115 --> 01:38:35,491
Gentlemen, we got a hot one.

1763
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:39,203
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage,
high-speed car chase in progress.

1764
01:38:39,203 --> 01:38:41,122
Yes. Gun, gun.

1765
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:43,249
Pass up the guns. Pass them up.
Let's go, people.

1766
01:38:43,249 --> 01:38:44,959
There we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1767
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:46,460
Good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?

1768
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:48,004
I do.

1769
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:49,881
All right, you, sweetie.
Come on, let's go. Move.

1770
01:38:49,881 --> 01:38:51,507
- Move. Let's go.
- Come on.

1771
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:04,645
Cool, a helicopter.
Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1772
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:11,277
Jesus.

1773
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:18,910
- Who are those guys?
- They're Chechen investors.

1774
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:22,038
We were going to do a Chechen version
of Dora the Explorer.

1775
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:23,706
Anyway, it went terribly wrong.

1776
01:39:26,877 --> 01:39:29,086
I feel like it's not fair
that they have a helicopter.

1777
01:39:30,088 --> 01:39:31,172
Oh, no.

1778
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:33,633
Damn it.

1779
01:39:37,512 --> 01:39:39,972
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1780
01:39:39,972 --> 01:39:41,515
VO5 Hot Oil.

1781
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:47,146
You're going to wreck.
There's cars coming from both directions.

1782
01:39:47,146 --> 01:39:48,356
I am not going to wreck.

1783
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,068
- I am going to wreck. You're right.
- You want me to drive?

1784
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:14,757
- This was a very clever idea.
- Yeah.

1785
01:40:26,853 --> 01:40:28,145
They're gone.

1786
01:40:29,564 --> 01:40:30,648
Let's go.

1787
01:40:42,953 --> 01:40:46,414
They are Nigerians.
Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.

1788
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:55,506
- This is a shortcut.
- Are you kidding me?

1789
01:40:55,506 --> 01:40:56,799
You cannot go down there.

1790
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,225
What are you doing?

1791
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:13,524
Hit him.

1792
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:22,616
- Where are we?
- Chelsea Pier.

1793
01:41:29,082 --> 01:41:30,166
What the hell?

1794
01:41:31,501 --> 01:41:32,585
Jesus.

1795
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,802
Them having a helicopter
is definitely cheating.

1796
01:41:42,554 --> 01:41:43,637
Go.

1797
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:49,852
Come on.

1798
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,314
We're cops. Hit the chopper.

1799
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:19,090
This is Martin and Fosse, en route.
Back off. This is our collar.

1800
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:23,594
Set up a perimeter.
No arrests until we get there.

1801
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:24,970
Take the light.

1802
01:42:45,158 --> 01:42:46,700
Do not authorize that transfer.

1803
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,369
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1804
01:42:48,369 --> 01:42:50,871
He will tell you not to authorize it, okay?
Tell him.

1805
01:42:50,871 --> 01:42:53,582
- Tell him.
- Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1806
01:42:53,582 --> 01:42:54,750
Approve it.

1807
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:57,294
Now.

1808
01:42:57,294 --> 01:42:58,963
Do not touch anything.

1809
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:01,632
I swear to God
I will blow your head all over this desk.

1810
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,135
Not a person in this room believes
you will shoot this clerk.

1811
01:43:04,135 --> 01:43:05,302
Yeah?

1812
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,182
Thank you so much, gentlemen,
for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1813
01:43:10,182 --> 01:43:13,686
I have two competing bids
from jilted investors.

1814
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:16,605
They're at 30 million, and holding.

1815
01:43:17,315 --> 01:43:19,275
- Wait. Can't you let me...
- Take him away.

1816
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,402
But computers.

1817
01:43:22,487 --> 01:43:26,949
What if, one day, they were in charge?

1818
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:32,621
Now if you don't shut up,
I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.

1819
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:34,790
That's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.

1820
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:36,125
Now.

1821
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:44,341
You just stood there.

1822
01:43:44,341 --> 01:43:47,219
I didn't know that "now" meant that.
How am I supposed to know that?

1823
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:49,180
- I knew what that meant.
- Shut up.

1824
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:52,308
You kill us and you kill Ershon.
You're out 30 million dollars.

1825
01:43:52,308 --> 01:43:54,477
- Who's got the golden goose now, huh?
- Yeah.

1826
01:43:58,523 --> 01:44:00,107
Shit.

1827
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:02,985
He's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.

1828
01:44:02,985 --> 01:44:04,945
He immediately called your bluff.

1829
01:44:04,945 --> 01:44:06,864
Get up. And kill the police.

1830
01:44:06,864 --> 01:44:08,407
I just want to make sure I get it right.

1831
01:44:08,407 --> 01:44:11,911
Did you want this transfer approved
or not approved?

1832
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:14,747
You, mate, I am going to kill just for fun.

1833
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:19,084
Police, don't move. Drop your weapons.

1834
01:44:19,084 --> 01:44:22,087
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy.

1835
01:44:22,087 --> 01:44:25,132
I hope you like the taste
of prison food and penis.

1836
01:44:25,132 --> 01:44:28,010
- Police. Down on the ground.
- Let me see your hands.

1837
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:38,145
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- Hey.

1838
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:41,398
Hey, Gene. Captain. I am sorry.

1839
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:43,400
- I am sorry.
- That's okay. Don't worry about it.

1840
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,985
You can call me Gene
when we're not in the office.

1841
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,613
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1842
01:44:47,613 --> 01:44:49,782
Attaboy.

1843
01:44:49,782 --> 01:44:51,909
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.

1844
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,037
We're losing him. We're losing him.
He's dying.

1845
01:44:55,497 --> 01:44:58,832
No. No, no, no, no. I am just resting.
I am just resting.

1846
01:44:58,832 --> 01:45:01,085
- I am sorry. Did I hurt you?
- I was just resting.

1847
01:45:01,085 --> 01:45:02,711
- Are you all right?
- Just resting.

1848
01:45:02,711 --> 01:45:04,213
Hey, let me tell you something.

1849
01:45:04,213 --> 01:45:07,132
As far as paperwork goes,
we will take care of it.

1850
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,051
- You know why?
- Why?

1851
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:10,636
Ain't too proud to beg.

1852
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:12,471
Come on.

1853
01:45:12,471 --> 01:45:14,390
- What?
- It's not funny any more.

1854
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:17,017
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- TLC references.

1855
01:45:17,017 --> 01:45:19,103
Still nothing. I swear to you.

1856
01:45:19,437 --> 01:45:24,775
I am going to go over and check on Terry.
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.

1857
01:45:24,775 --> 01:45:27,653
It was the king of the mutt cases,

1858
01:45:27,653 --> 01:45:30,864
but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.

1859
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:36,870
Within 24 hours of learning
about Ershon's scheme

1860
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,998
and Lendl's massive losses,

1861
01:45:38,998 --> 01:45:41,792
the government issued TARP funds
to bail out Lendl.

1862
01:45:41,792 --> 01:45:46,422
Lendl is in everything,
and we're going to go everywhere...

1863
01:45:46,422 --> 01:45:48,299
They were too big to fail.

1864
01:45:48,299 --> 01:45:53,596
Ershon now resides in Palomino
Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.

1865
01:45:53,596 --> 01:45:56,765
He still invests. Currency's just different.

1866
01:45:57,809 --> 01:46:00,227
Roger Wesley was linked
to the Beaman murder

1867
01:46:00,227 --> 01:46:04,106
by security cam footage
which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.

1868
01:46:04,106 --> 01:46:06,025
It only showed the back of their heads.

1869
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:10,237
But Allen's Faceback app
was able to get a match to their faces.

1870
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,573
Terry married Francine.

1871
01:46:12,573 --> 01:46:15,618
He played harp at the reception
and it was beautiful.

1872
01:46:15,618 --> 01:46:17,244
He had learned how to play it
in the eighth grade

1873
01:46:17,244 --> 01:46:20,664
to make fun of the fairy
that lived up the street.

1874
01:46:21,082 --> 01:46:24,335
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man,
but she declined.

1875
01:46:24,627 --> 01:46:28,839
Let's be honest,
we all want to be superstars and hotshots.

1876
01:46:28,839 --> 01:46:30,132
But guess what?

1877
01:46:30,132 --> 01:46:33,719
The people that do the real work,
the ones that make the difference,

1878
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:36,972
you don't see them on TV
or on the front page.

1879
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:41,101
I am talking about the day-in,
day-outers, the grinders.

1880
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:44,355
Come on, man, you know who
I am talking about: The other guys.

1881
01:46:44,355 --> 01:46:45,606
- See? That's a no-go.
- Hey, hey.

1882
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:48,359
You think you broke this Ershon case open?

1883
01:46:48,777 --> 01:46:49,985
You did nothing.

1884
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:51,987
Corporate lobbyists are spending millions

1885
01:46:51,987 --> 01:46:54,323
to make sure guys like Ershon
keep doing what they do.

1886
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,200
Derek Jeter?

1887
01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:00,704
Yeah, it's me. You were set up
that night you shot me, Terry.

1888
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:03,791
- I told you.
- They knew by putting someone like you

1889
01:47:03,791 --> 01:47:06,835
with a quick trigger finger next to that door
where I do my pre-game walk,

1890
01:47:06,835 --> 01:47:09,380
it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.

1891
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:12,007
Now, I have been doing my own investigation
on the banking industry,

1892
01:47:12,007 --> 01:47:14,218
and I was close. I was real close.

1893
01:47:14,636 --> 01:47:15,803
So I forgive you, Terry.

1894
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:18,472
I appreciate that, man. I am sorry about
what happened.

1895
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:20,224
I am glad you're doing better.

1896
01:47:20,683 --> 01:47:23,018
The whole damn system is clogged up
with dirty money.

1897
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:26,855
And the news doesn't say a word about it.
because who owns them?

1898
01:47:26,855 --> 01:47:29,441
The same corporations
that own the government.

1899
01:47:30,026 --> 01:47:31,735
Courts and the law is all we have left.

1900
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:34,530
So here's you guys' next case.

1901
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:38,534
Guy by the name of Carl Bachand,
CEO of Killister Bank.

1902
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:43,038
He took three billion in TARP funds.
He's crooked. He's real crooked.

1903
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:48,168
Take him down, but be careful.
He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24/7.

1904
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:50,379
Thanks, Derek.

1905
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:53,799
Hey, Derek. Wait.
What if we need to get in touch with you,

1906
01:47:53,799 --> 01:47:56,218
get some more information
or some tickets or something?

1907
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,137
What just happened?

1908
01:48:01,015 --> 01:48:04,101
Goldman Sachs.
This case is going to be nasty.

1909
01:48:06,771 --> 01:48:08,480
Hi. Cute glasses.

1910
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:11,442
- What was that?
- What?

1911
01:48:11,442 --> 01:48:15,154
What? Dude, what is it with you
and hot ladies? What's your secret?

1912
01:48:15,154 --> 01:48:17,906
Honestly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1913
01:48:17,906 --> 01:48:20,033
Tell me who you lost your virginity to.

1914
01:48:20,033 --> 01:48:23,162
She actually became a TV actress.
Heather Locklear.

1915
01:48:23,162 --> 01:48:24,913
Heather Locklear, what?

1916
01:48:24,913 --> 01:48:26,623
- You have heard of her?
- Come on.

1917
01:48:26,623 --> 01:48:30,836
- She was much chubbier back then.
- I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.

1918
01:53:31,429 --> 01:53:33,096
That was you.
You don't have a sense of humor.

1919
01:53:33,096 --> 01:53:34,681
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.

1920
01:53:35,183 --> 01:53:36,725
If you say something funny, I will laugh.

1921
01:53:36,725 --> 01:53:39,519
- All right, I am going to tell you a great joke.
- Please. I love jokes.

1922
01:53:39,519 --> 01:53:42,230
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

1923
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:46,735
- It's time to get laid.
- Already feels inappropriate.

1924
01:53:47,069 --> 01:53:48,820
So he goes to the lady at the whorehouse,
he goes, "Miss,

1925
01:53:49,197 --> 01:53:52,365
"look, I know usually you want money, but
I don't have any money and it's my birthday.

1926
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,451
"Do you think I could have sex with you
for this duck?"

1927
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:57,204
- Was he a farmer?
- No.

1928
01:53:57,413 --> 01:54:01,708
That's probably a Health Code violation,
bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.

1929
01:54:02,126 --> 01:54:03,710
They weren't going to have sex with the duck.

1930
01:54:03,961 --> 01:54:05,712
No, I just mean Health Code violation

1931
01:54:05,712 --> 01:54:09,424
to have the duck brought into
a facility like that.

1932
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:13,094
So, anyway, she says, "Yes, I will do it."

1933
01:54:13,596 --> 01:54:16,056
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

1934
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:19,768
- He gives her what?
- The high, hard one. She loves it.

1935
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:23,063
She goes, "You know what? If you do that
again, I will give you your duck back."

1936
01:54:23,397 --> 01:54:25,315
- It's like getting laid twice for free.
- So... I am sorry.

1937
01:54:25,315 --> 01:54:26,525
I am so sorry.

1938
01:54:26,818 --> 01:54:30,779
- The duck is payment for sexual intercourse.
- Yes. Yes.

1939
01:54:30,779 --> 01:54:32,072
- Very good.
- He used the duck as payment,

1940
01:54:32,072 --> 01:54:33,782
and now he's being paid back the duck.

1941
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:37,285
He goes, "Oh, my God, this is
the greatest birthday ever." He does it again.

1942
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:41,164
- Now he's walking home, right? Walking...
- So she was satisfied with duck.

1943
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:43,458
- With a duck as currency...
- Yes.

1944
01:54:43,458 --> 01:54:46,002
...to her. Great. Good.

1945
01:54:46,337 --> 01:54:50,090
So he's walking home, now he can't wait
to get home to tell his father. Right?

1946
01:54:50,466 --> 01:54:52,592
He's walking down the street with the duck,
and all of a sudden, voom,

1947
01:54:52,592 --> 01:54:54,094
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

1948
01:54:54,094 --> 01:54:55,554
- Kills the duck?
- Killed the duck.

1949
01:54:55,554 --> 01:54:57,806
- So the duck is now dead.
- The duck is dead.

1950
01:54:58,307 --> 01:55:01,601
The kid starts crying, truck driver stops,
he's all upset, he didn't mean...

1951
01:55:01,601 --> 01:55:04,896
Of course he's crying. He's a 13-year-old boy
who's just had sex, twice,

1952
01:55:04,896 --> 01:55:08,525
- and he watched his beloved duck die.
- Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

1953
01:55:08,525 --> 01:55:10,610
So far, I don't know
how this is ever going to be funny.

1954
01:55:10,903 --> 01:55:13,363
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck,
he gives him two dollars.

1955
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,073
And the kid's happy with the two bucks?

1956
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:19,035
He's ecstatic. He got laid twice,
and now he's got two dollars on top of it.

1957
01:55:19,035 --> 01:55:21,580
Seems like a duck would be worth
a lot more than two dollars.

1958
01:55:22,748 --> 01:55:24,291
This was a while back. You what I am...

1959
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:27,168
So he goes home, his dad goes,
"What happened? What happened?

1960
01:55:27,168 --> 01:55:30,714
"Tell me. Tell me." He goes,
"Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,

1961
01:55:30,714 --> 01:55:32,382
"I got a duck for the fuck,

1962
01:55:32,382 --> 01:55:34,217
"and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck."

1963
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:38,513
So it's like a limerick.

1964
01:55:39,724 --> 01:55:40,974
You didn't think that was funny?

1965
01:55:41,434 --> 01:55:43,310
I thought it was entertaining
at the end, sure,

1966
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,770
the way all the words were put together,

1967
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:47,397
but in terms of content?

1968
01:55:49,025 --> 01:55:50,150
No.

1969
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:56,990
Get the check-check from Shen-Shen.
Let's get out of here.

1970
01:56:02,204 --> 01:56:06,374
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1971
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:07,876
And cut.
