1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,231
<i>Papa, Papa, come in here!</i>

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,234
Hey, Papa's here.

3
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:06,002
Papa, I'm so scared.

4
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:07,570
There's a monster in my closet.

5
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:08,771
Oh, buddy.
Shh.

6
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:10,339
It's okay, I'm here.

7
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,342
Monster's aren't real,
my little pierogi.

8
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:14,477
But I saw it.
It was big and hairy.

9
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:15,878
You just had
a nightmare, buddy.

10
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,180
No, it was real!

11
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:18,581
I'm sure it felt that way.

12
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:22,185
But I am gonna open
this closet,

13
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:24,686
and I'm gonna show you
that there's nothing in there.

14
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:26,189
Don't do that, Papa!

15
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,692
See? Nothing...

16
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:30,860
Whoo!

17
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,129
Ah, hey, Chuck.

18
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,074
It's Pimento.

20
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,885
And now Nikolaj says
he's too frightened

21
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:58,154
to ever sleep again,
so that's just superduper.

22
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:00,089
I don't understand
what he's so scared about.

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,391
If I was there to kill him,
he never would've heard me.

24
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,194
A thing you told him
several times.

25
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,962
God, Nikolaj is having
such a rich childhood.

26
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,164
Can we back up?

27
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,632
What were you doing
in Boyle's closet

28
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,301
- in the first place?
- Well, I still had a key

29
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:13,236
from when I was crashing there
last year, and I wanted

30
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,438
to shower and anoint my body
with essential oils

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,040
before I saw Rosa.
Duh.

32
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,108
Well, she's gonna be
so psyched that you're back.

33
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,476
Where have you been
all this time?

34
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:22,244
Figgis has been locked up
for a month.

35
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,280
I was in prison
in Uzbekistan.

36
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:25,848
It's actually not as bad
as it sounds.

37
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,219
I deserve this!

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,453
Why were you in jail?

39
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,455
Ah, I got shot down smuggling
ammo to a rebel group,

40
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,289
flying an old Soviet prop plane.

41
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:35,358
They tortured us.

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,960
Made me eat
my co-pilot's tongue.

43
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,761
Oof, now I've got
a taste for it.

44
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,163
The important thing is
you're safe and sound

45
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:42,165
and back in Brooklyn.

46
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,199
Thank you, Captain.

47
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,004
Ooh, you smell good!
Wowza.

48
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,006
- And end of hug.
- Okay.

49
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,341
I'll see about
getting you reinstated

50
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:52,809
to the NYPD immediately.

51
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,410
I think this deserves
another hug.

52
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,145
- Me too.
- Nope.

53
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:57,547
- One was sufficient.
- Cool.

54
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,156
Pimento, you son of a bitch!

55
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,315
You're the son of a bitch!

56
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,551
Oh, we'll see
who's a son of a bitch.

57
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:03,886
Oh, yes, we will.

58
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:04,921
Aww.

59
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:07,323
It's so sweet.

60
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:09,826
And violent.

61
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,727
Yeah, this is awkward.

62
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,896
I'm sure they'll stop soon.

63
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:16,399
And it's escalating.
Let's go.

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,967
I left my phone
in the briefing room.

65
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,869
It's been 20 minutes.
You think they're still...

66
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,271
They're not doing anything.

67
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,705
Kissing just turned into talk.

68
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,440
It's like, why even work here?

69
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,542
Listen up!
We have an announcement to make.

70
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,177
When I was in
that Uzbek prison,

71
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:29,512
choking on my own blood

72
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,481
because my face
was being beaten in,

73
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:33,582
I realized, life is funny!

74
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:34,884
That's what you realized?

75
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:35,952
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's short.

76
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:37,086
We're picking up
where we left off

77
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,321
when Adrian went into hiding.

78
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:40,290
We're getting married tomorrow.

79
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,857
Tomorrow.
That's real quick.

80
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,226
Thank you, Sarge.

81
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:44,794
And we want it
to be beautiful,

82
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:47,063
and lush, and romantic,

83
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:48,798
just like a Nancy Meyers movie.

84
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,133
- She's our favorite director.
- Aw.

85
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,334
I love "You've Got Mail."

86
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,336
- That's Nora Ephron, you idiot.
- I know.

87
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,937
Wait, hold up.

88
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,873
Planning a wedding like
that in 14 hours would be

89
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:59,876
the greatest organizational
challenge in history.

90
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,144
How are you gonna do it?

91
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,578
I was kinda hoping you would.

92
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:03,880
I thought I was supposed
to get you guys

93
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,615
the wedding present!

94
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:07,216
- Of course I will!
- That's my girl.

95
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,318
All right.

96
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,652
Listen up, people.

97
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:11,354
The next 14 hours
are gonna be hell,

98
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,056
but in the end
you will have the satisfaction

99
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:15,091
of knowing that you've finally
done something worthwhile

100
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:16,359
- with your lives.
- I kinda think

101
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,727
- the police work we do...
- Eh-eh-eh!

102
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:20,697
I don't have time to stroke
your damn ego, Sergeant.

103
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:22,281
Let's make a wedding!

104
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,467
Hey, Jake.

105
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:26,769
I need a wedding favor.

106
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,137
Of course.
Anything.

107
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:29,939
Except killing someone,
or maiming someone,

108
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,641
or breaking the law in any way,
or nudity.

109
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,343
Also I don't like waking up
super early in the morning...

110
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,544
you know what, why don't
you just tell me what you want?

111
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:36,512
Cool, I need to go
to Neustadter, New York.

112
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:38,648
I gotta pick up a pair
of ruby earrings I pawned

113
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:39,781
before I went into hiding.

114
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,351
Neustadter's like
six hours away.

115
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,086
I'm not so sure we can
get there and back in time.

116
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,021
Jake, there's no wedding
without the earrings.

117
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,789
My grandmother wore them
on her wedding day,

118
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,358
and said they blessed her union.

119
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,393
Do you want this union
to be blessed, Jake?

120
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,729
Or do you want this union
to be friggin' unblessed?

121
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,797
Blessed, totally blessed.
I'll do it, it's fine.

122
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,532
But I should warn you,
my car is a piece of junk

123
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,234
- and it's always breaking down.
- Ah, come on!

124
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,336
The universe isn't gonna
let anything bad happen

125
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:03,406
to two best friends...
unless we're in a fiery crash,

126
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,708
and our bodies are burned
beyond recognition.

127
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,844
Ooh, Gina's got jelly beans!

128
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:09,612
Pimento, no.

129
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,280
- Bad.
- Sorry, Gina.

130
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:13,383
That was amazing.

131
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:14,951
He actually listens to you.

132
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,552
Hey, you should come
with us on this trip.

133
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:17,620
You know, in case
he starts acting...

134
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,355
- Bat crap loony tunes.
- Yes.

135
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:20,857
You can use your powers
to keep him in check.

136
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,358
- Yeah, people fear me.
- Mm.

137
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,527
The only reason
I'm not your boss right now

138
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:26,262
is 'cause I'd hate
to do that to Holt.

139
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,264
- He needs this.
- And also you're not a cop.

140
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:30,566
Well, you're not the basis
of a character on "Empire,"

141
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,969
Jake, but I don't throw that in
your face every damn day.

142
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,637
- So you will come with us?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

143
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:35,938
- You da man!
- Bye, girl!

144
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,774
See ya in the car, girl.

145
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,942
Okay.
First, the good news.

146
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:42,311
I've generated a detailed
timeline broken down

147
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,647
into 30-second increments
to keep us on track.

148
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:47,550
The bad news:
we're already 16.5 increments

149
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,218
- behind schedule.
- Oh, man.

150
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,577
Terry feels overwhelmed.

151
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:52,021
Good!
Use it!

152
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,956
Neil Armstrong was overwhelmed
when he walked on the Moon,

153
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,024
but you know what he did?

154
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,459
He walked on the Moon!

155
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,927
Charles, you're in charge
of food.

156
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:59,462
I've been planning
a nuptial menu

157
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,030
since the day I met Genevieve.

158
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,467
Warning, it will be delicious
and highly erotic.

159
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:07,370
Your menu is not gonna involve
animal genitalia, is it?

160
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:11,107
No, I was gonna make...
not that.

161
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,508
Terry,
you're on hair and makeup.

162
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:13,509
I've seen your little
girls' pigtails,

163
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,911
so I know you can do it.

164
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:17,280
They actually prefer
my hair work to their mommy's.

165
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:20,917
I love their little heads.

166
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:22,819
Terry, what's going on, man?

167
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,821
It's just a matter of time
before I'm doing their hair

168
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:26,189
at their weddings.

169
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,256
It goes so fast.
They're still babies!

170
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,659
Pull it together, Jeffords!

171
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,427
Scully and Hitchcock,
you're in charge of seating.

172
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,062
Smart move, Amy.
I've been called

173
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,831
the Leonardo da Vinci
of sitting on my ass.

174
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:35,931
Great.

175
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,667
And, Captain,
you can help me decorate.

176
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:39,469
I'm at your disposal,
just tell me what to do.

177
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,036
I'm here to implement
your vision.

178
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,171
Well, we just wanna
keep it classy.

179
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:44,474
Got it.
Balloon arch.

180
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,275
- What?
- Say no more, it's done.

181
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:48,611
I'm off to the nearest
balloon store.

182
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,279
Okay, Rosa.

183
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,248
You go to the office,
have a couple bellinis,

184
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,183
- and just relax.
- What's a Bellini?

185
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,517
Peach juice and champagne.

186
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,219
Peach juice and champagne?
What am I, six?

187
00:05:57,254 --> 00:05:59,088
Come on, just try it.

188
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,689
It's what Nancy Meyers
would drink.

189
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:03,392
Fine.
For Nancy.

190
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,461
So, big day.
How you feeling, buddy?

191
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,330
Good, giddy.

192
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:08,764
I've never felt giddy before.

193
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,132
Didn't realize how close
it was to hungry.

194
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,534
You know, it's possible
you're just hungry.

195
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:13,603
- When's the last time you ate?
- Uh, three days ago?

196
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:15,404
- Ah.
- You excited for being married?

197
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,306
Yeah!
I love Rosa.

198
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,742
I can't wait to just jam
my tongue in her earholes,

199
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,043
and eat the hair off her head.

200
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:23,112
- Hoo! I'm giddy.
- Aw, that's cute.

201
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:25,081
All right, we're looking
for 381 Smith Street.

202
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:26,215
It should be up here.

203
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,050
Hopefully they still have
your earrings.

204
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:30,286
You sure we're looking
for 381?

205
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:33,823
'Cause 381's looking
a little crispy.

206
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,658
Oh, no.
It burned down.

207
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,959
How did this happen?

208
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,061
Uh, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

209
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,296
We'll think of something,
all right?

210
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:41,364
Nope!

211
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,866
This is a sign
from the universe.

212
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,701
I can't marry Rosa.

213
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,091
Guys, the wedding's off.

214
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:52,298
Oh, no, no, no!

215
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:53,833
That's it!
We're not getting married.

216
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,134
- This is a disaster.
- Come on.

217
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:56,502
I mean, they're just earrings,
right?

218
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,537
We can get another pair,
or we could make some new ones.

219
00:06:58,538 --> 00:06:59,939
All we need is, like,
a blacksmith.

220
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,208
Or a smelter... a smelt man.
That can't be right.

221
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,409
The point is
you can still married.

222
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,777
No, Jake.
You don't understand.

223
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:06,745
The universe is
sending me a sign.

224
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,647
And when the universe talks,
I listen!

225
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:11,116
Well, I personally don't even
really believe in signs, so...

226
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:12,917
What?
Then you deserve to die.

227
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:14,019
- Ah...
- The sign was real.

228
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,654
If I ignore it
and marry Rosa anyway,

229
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:18,390
I'm basically asking
the universe to stomp on my balls.

230
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,525
Okay, good point.

231
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,093
Hey, Gina,
I could use your help here.

232
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:22,428
You wanna maybe
weigh in on this one?

233
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:23,529
Yeah, sure.

234
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,498
You're right.
The marriage is cursed.

235
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,732
What? No!
You weighed in wrong.

236
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm sorry, Jake,
it's an omen.

237
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:30,836
And I'm not taking your side
against the universe's.

238
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,838
- It's hundred of years old.
- What if there was something

239
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,206
in the universe that could prove
to you that you

240
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:35,741
should still get married?
What would that be?

241
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:37,376
Finding his
grandma's earrings.

242
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:39,512
Or we could cut Rosa's ears off,
and then it's like

243
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:40,913
the earrings
don't even make sense.

244
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:42,715
Thank you!
Someone's trying to help.

245
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,983
Okay, so the earrings.

246
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:45,050
Maybe somebody bought them

247
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,152
before the place burned down,
right?

248
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,252
We could track 'em down.

249
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,788
And lookee here.

250
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,123
I just got the owner's name.
That's good, right?

251
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,125
Okay, maybe there is
a little bit of hope.

252
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,694
You're damn right there is.

253
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:56,862
Suck it, universe!

254
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:58,831
- Are you crazy?
- Why would you even say that?

255
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,033
Come on, man!

256
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,368
How are the chairs coming,
guys?

257
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:03,402
Shh.
We're working!

258
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:04,803
- This one's good.
- Okay.

259
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:06,605
- So we'll go with that one?
- No, I said it was good.

260
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,039
I didn't say it was right.

261
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,942
Wow, you're taking this
really seriously.

262
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,744
Amy,
will you taste this batter?

263
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:13,646
Mm-hmm.

264
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,714
Hmm...
I think it's a little off.

265
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,383
You know what's off?
Your mouth!

266
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,985
Why Jake lets your stupid tongue
anywhere near him,

267
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:21,487
I'll never know.

268
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,488
Nope, I forgot the sugar.
That's on me.

269
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:27,927
Whoa, you really made
the balloon arch.

270
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:30,829
Made? No.
I birthed her.

271
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,231
There's no form more graceful
than the arch,

272
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:36,001
no object more whimsical
than the balloon.

273
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:39,004
Yes, you and I think that,
but...

274
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,140
what will Rosa think?

275
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,675
Good point.

276
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:45,444
Rosa would want a much,
much bigger balloon arch.

277
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,012
Back to the balloon store.

278
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:49,215
Uh, Amy?
We've got a problem.

279
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:50,715
- What?
- Rosa's drunk.

280
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,685
Rosa?
No. How?

281
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:54,053
Bellinis rule!

282
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:57,021
Nancy Meyers, you've done it
again, you saucy bitch.

283
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,592
For the last time,
I don't have your earrings.

284
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:01,059
They didn't survive the fire.

285
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:03,195
Aw, no, this is really bad.

286
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:05,497
Well, not necessarily.
I mean, maybe the universe

287
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:07,233
allowed something else
to survive, you know?

288
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,268
- Like a rabbit's foot.
- I don't think you understand

289
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,270
- how pawn shops work.
- I don't think you understand

290
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:12,404
how they work.
Yours burned down!

291
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:13,739
I'm so sorry
you lost everything.

292
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,375
I'm just really worked up.
No, please don't!

293
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:18,310
Okay, so...

294
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,813
I know that seemed like
a little bit of a dead end.

295
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:22,615
She's got the earrings.

296
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,116
- She does?
- She stole all the merch,

297
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:25,918
and then burned down the store.

298
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,853
She was wearing a necklace
that I also pawned there.

299
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:30,522
Oh, snap!
Signs on signs on signs!

300
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:31,790
Are you sure
it's the same necklace?

301
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,359
Uh, yeah, Jake.
I once punched it

302
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,194
through a guy's throat,
so I'm pretty sure

303
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:36,696
- I remember it.
- I stand corrected.

304
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,063
All right,
I'm gonna call the local police

305
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:39,632
- and get a warrant.
- Oh, don't bother.

306
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,300
Let's just kick down the door,
and take back what's mine.

307
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,135
No! No, no, no.
That's a bad idea.

308
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:44,870
He's right.
Just use the lattice.

309
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,438
The upstairs window's open.

310
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,906
- No!
- Nice!

311
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:49,074
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to make

312
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,342
this wedding happen.
What are you doing?

313
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,777
Trying to keep us
out of prison.

314
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:53,479
You know what, forget it.
I'll just deal with him myself...

315
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,014
nope, he's already on the roof.

316
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:57,115
Aha! Yeah, dog!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

317
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,318
- Rosa, what happened?
- Sorry.

318
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:00,886
I didn't know you could drunk
off champers.

319
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,755
- I mean, it's half bubbles.
- Don't worry, Amy.

320
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:05,090
I got this.
I'm a master at sobering up.

321
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:06,592
- Are you sure?
- Uh, you don't go

322
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,560
to the Renaissance Faire
every weekend in your 20s

323
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,229
without learning
how to handle your mead.

324
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,397
Great.
Thanks, Charles.

325
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,399
Mm-hmm.

326
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,900
Charles,
I'm getting married today.

327
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,403
Yes, you are.

328
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:19,371
And I'm gonna make sure
you are sober

329
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:22,007
when that happens.
Now I just need cayenne pepper

330
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,443
- and some horse milk.
- Marriage is the best.

331
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:26,578
Hey, how come you and Genevieve
aren't married?

332
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,681
- Huh?
- Uh...

333
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,649
- you know, it's complicated.
- No, it's not.

334
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,584
It's easy.
Bring her down here.

335
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,687
- We'll all get married!
- Yeah, right.

336
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:37,523
- She doesn't want that.
- Whoa, that sounds...

337
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,491
No, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:42,026
No, no, no.
Uh-uh, no, no.

339
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:43,362
Everything's great with us.

340
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:45,197
I mean, if it was up to me,
we'd get hitched,

341
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:46,832
but she had
a really bad divorce, so...

342
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,967
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does that upset you?

343
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:51,102
I'm good!
Yeah, I'm good!

344
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:52,771
I'm so sad.

345
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,305
I love her so much.

346
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:56,108
I wanna marry her butt so bad.

347
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,810
- To Genevieve's butt!
- To Genevieve's butt!

348
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,714
<i>Look</i> at all this crap.
See, I told you.

349
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,650
They took all their merchandise,
and burned their store.

350
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:06,884
This is a bad idea.
We should leave now.

351
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,354
What? No.
All we're gonna do

352
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:09,588
is find the earrings,

353
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,790
and then light this place
on fire for revenge.

354
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,759
Check it out!
Rainstick.

355
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,194
- Keeping it.
- No, you're not.

356
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:17,029
- That is a crime.
- Untrue.

357
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,397
Once you steal something,

358
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:19,665
none of your stuff
belongs to you.

359
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,100
- I've heard that too.
- No, you haven't.

360
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,401
No one has.
Put that down.

361
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:23,736
Okay.

362
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:25,503
Gina!
Be a quieter robber!

363
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,740
But you told me
to put it down.

364
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,208
Hi, we met earlier.

365
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,776
You're breaking into my house?

366
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,945
Or are you breaking into
our house?

367
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,381
- Yeah.
- Dino! Robbers! Dino!

368
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,049
Aha!
I found the earrings!

369
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,283
Dino! Get up here!

370
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:40,119
Yeah, Dino!
Get in here!

371
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,621
So you can watch me
light your house on fire!

372
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:44,656
Whoa! Okay, everybody,
just keep it cool.

373
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,025
Everybody be
chilly chill chill.

374
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,328
I am gonna slice
your face off!

375
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,930
Not chill, Dino.

376
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,564
Let me in there,
you sons of bitches!

377
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,702
Wait, wait!

378
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,537
The trellis won't hold all three
of us at the same time.

379
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:01,440
Smart.

380
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:02,708
- Whoo!
- Ooh!

381
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,078
That was awesome!
I love being a police officer!

382
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,913
That was the opposite
of being a police officer.

383
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:10,516
- We just robbed somebody.
- Who robbed us!

384
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,484
The universe is back on track,
baby!

385
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:13,785
We got grandma's earrings back!

386
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,320
And the rainstick!

387
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:17,689
- Which you will be returning.
- Uh, sure I will.

388
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,891
How are we doing on traffic?

389
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:21,093
- Green all the way.
- All right, looks like

390
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,228
we're actually gonna make it
in time for this wedding.

391
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,296
Thank you, universe.

392
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,198
Thank you for blessing
this marriage.

393
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:30,702
Okay, I know
what you're thinking,

394
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,204
but this is not a sign.

395
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,540
I just have to pump the gas
twice, and turn it back on.

396
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,175
This happens all the time.

397
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:38,277
Oh, boy.

398
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,338
This has never happened before.
Everybody out!

399
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:42,445
This is the worst day
of my life.

400
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:44,318
The universe doesn't want me
to marry Rosa.

401
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,686
Look, it's gonna be fine.

402
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,588
We'll get the car fixed
and make it back in time.

403
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:48,889
Gina, when's the tow truck
getting here?

404
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,392
No idea, I'm talking
to my spiritual advisor.

405
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,060
He says we have
an engine problem.

406
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,061
Yeah, I know, that's why
I said call a tow truck!

407
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:57,397
So you meant my spiritual
advisor is right?

408
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:59,800
Guys! This is my fault.
I should've just given up

409
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,635
when fate burned down
the pawn shop, okay?

410
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,904
Stupid Adrian.
Stupid Adrian!

411
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:06,073
- Idiot! Read the signs!
- Enough!

412
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,175
I'm so sick
of this garbage, all right?

413
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:09,476
The two of you need to stop

414
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:12,012
looking for signs everywhere...
oh, my God, a sign.

415
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,314
Whoo! He can fly!
Prop planes!

416
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,548
You can fly, you can fly!

417
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,450
I'm a vessel
for the universe.

418
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:20,520
Wow.
The chairs look amazing.

419
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,723
I can't believe you two aren't
my biggest problem today.

420
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,358
We're not?
Who is?

421
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,125
<i>My arch.
Isn't she beautiful?</i>

422
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:31,564
I got eye-rolled <i>to,</i>
not<i> about!</i>

423
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,566
While Pimento stares at Rosa,

424
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:37,036
we'll all be staring at...
her.

425
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:39,339
- Yes, we will.
- She's truly breathtaking.

426
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,874
There's a double meaning
to that.

427
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,211
The breath that it takes
to inflate all those balloons.

428
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:47,848
Of course I used the hand pump,
but the bon mot still works.

429
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:49,249
Oh, no! What's happening?

430
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,284
Someone tell me
what's happening.

431
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:52,086
- I got some more bad news.
- Oh.

432
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:54,488
Oh, wow.
That thing's huge.

433
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,290
Didn't Rosa want things
to be classy?

434
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,791
I mean, she's getting married,
not finishing a marathon.

435
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,227
So says the hair guy.

436
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,495
Stay in your lane, bucko.
Right, Santiago?

437
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,530
The arch sucks!
I'm sorry.

438
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:06,633
I didn't want to say anything
because you're my boss

439
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,570
and you were so excited,
but the truth is every time

440
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:12,506
I look at it I wanna die
and take you with me.

441
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,141
Well, I wish
you'd said something

442
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:15,876
before I spent
all day making it.

443
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,178
Of course,
you didn't want to...

444
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,215
"burst my bubble."
Pun intended.

445
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:25,018
And then...
you did.

446
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:33,026
Forget the arch!
Charles didn't sober up Rosa.

447
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:34,661
- She got him drunk!
- Oh, no.

448
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:35,745
How drunk is he?

449
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:38,098
Remember the night
they cancelled "Bunheads"?

450
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,232
- We're ruined.
- It's fine.

451
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,236
I'll handle it.
You got your hands full.

452
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:43,837
Yeah.

453
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:47,773
This is just 18 shots
of espresso.

454
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:50,177
It got me through the first
three months of having twins,

455
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,812
but I imagine it'll
sober you up too.

456
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:54,248
Aww, he's taking care of you.

457
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:55,448
Such a good father.

458
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:56,950
Ugh, I miss my father.

459
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,253
I used to be daddy's little
girl, but we never talk anymore.

460
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:00,854
- You don't?
- That's what happens.

461
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,990
You grow up,
your bond with your dad goes...

462
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,491
No, it doesn't always happen.

463
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,095
All right, not to special
daddies who put the time in.

464
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,463
You know, read them stories,
do their little pigtails.

465
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,399
Really, Sarge?

466
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,335
Who do you think
used to do my pigtails?

467
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:18,005
Why can't they
stay babies forever?

468
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,139
Berlini!

469
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,808
- Bellini!
- Bellini!

470
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,143
Okay, this is very scary,

471
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,977
but it's okay,
because you're a trained pilot.

472
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:26,013
No, I'm not.
I'm self-taught.

473
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:27,080
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

474
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,648
You can learn anything online.

475
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:30,049
Ooh, you should see me
do origami.

476
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,351
Oh, do you know
how to do a frog?

477
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:32,386
Oh, no!

478
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,620
- Can you do a swan?
- No.

479
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,122
- Can you do a crane?
- What's a crane?

480
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,156
Okay, he does not know
how to fly a plane.

481
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:41,195
All right, food is ready,
decorations are set,

482
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:43,030
guests should start arriving
any moment,

483
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:45,598
and the chairs
are still perfection.

484
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:48,902
She said they're perfection.
I'm so proud of you, buddy.

485
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,938
It was you.
You made this happen.

486
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:53,207
All right!
Let's show Rosa what we got.

487
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,174
Wait.
Where is Rosa?

488
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,880
Narc.

489
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,682
And that's why
you shouldn't drink.

490
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,516
Being drunk sounds terrible.

491
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:04,985
Hello, Amy,
I didn't see you there.

492
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,335
- How did the wedding go?
- Terry!

493
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:07,888
What the hell, man?
You said you were gonna

494
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,623
- sober them up.
- It was her fault.

495
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:12,192
My girls are never gonna grow up
and lose their virginity.

496
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:14,027
I lost my V-card to the woman

497
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:16,430
that refilled Nana's
oxygen tanks.

498
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,765
Her hands were so strong
from turning the nozzles.

499
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,335
This is a room of nightmares.

500
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:22,836
You're the nightmare.

501
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:25,672
You made me kill
my balloon baby.

502
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:26,873
Look at me.

503
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:29,876
So drunk, I'm alliterating
like a beatnik.

504
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:33,947
Okay, everybody outside now!

505
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,849
Just know that you brought this
on yourselves.

506
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,951
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

507
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:39,619
Can't we just go to sleep
for a winker?

508
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,388
We're way past winkers.

509
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,758
Scully, Hitchcock,
bring the frost.

510
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:50,363
No!

511
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,101
Nice job, you two.

512
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,669
We are nailing it today!

513
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,037
Hey!
We're back.

514
00:16:57,038 --> 00:16:58,905
Pimento's got the earrings,
guests are arriving...

515
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:01,141
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sobering these clowns up.

516
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:02,843
All right,
everyone go get dressed.

517
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,111
You would not believe

518
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,413
- the day I've had.
- You and me both, sister.

519
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:08,148
Rosa got drunk,
and then every time

520
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,951
I sent someone in to help her,
she got them drunk too!

521
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,352
It's like she was trying
to tank this thing.

522
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,254
Yeah, well, Pimento called off
the wedding three times

523
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,856
because of the universe.
If I didn't know them

524
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:19,092
any better, I'd think
they don't even wanna get married.

525
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:20,785
They don't wanna
get married!

526
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,704
Okay, so it seems like
they don't wanna get married.

527
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,339
But is it even our place
to say something?

528
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,640
- No, right?
- Right?

529
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:29,376
It's their decision,
even if it's a bad one.

530
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:30,644
They could always get divorced.

531
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:32,546
People love getting divorced!
My parents got divorced,

532
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:35,015
and all it did was scar
our family for years and years.

533
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,916
- We have to say something.
- Yeah.

534
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,486
I suppose I can see
how a balloon arch

535
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:42,089
- might've been a little too much.
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

536
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,457
No, you're supposed to say,

537
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,193
"This wedding looks
like garbage."

538
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,561
This wedding looks
like garbage.

539
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:50,998
No, no.
As long as the bride's happy.

540
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,799
Hey there, everyone.
Great wedding so far, right?

541
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,436
Uh, next up,
we're gonna take a quick break,

542
00:17:56,437 --> 00:17:59,206
which happens at every wedding,
but in the meantime,

543
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:00,574
how about a little
entertainment?

544
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,476
Boyle?
You got your devil sticks?

545
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,511
Always.

546
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:05,712
- Hey, Adrian.
- Yeah.

547
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,346
- We gotta talk.
- Really? Right now?

548
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,149
I'm working on my vows.
Hey!

549
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,984
What rhymes with juicy heinie?

550
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:12,419
Nothing.
Nothing rhymes with that.

551
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,354
- I would cut that line.
- But that's all I have.

552
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:16,623
Forget it.
The thing I wanna say is,

553
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,625
maybe the universe wasn't
telling you stuff today.

554
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,961
Maybe you were telling
yourself something.

555
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,063
- Telling myself what?
- Yeah, tell himself what?

556
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,098
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a part of this journey.

557
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,601
Don't you dare
try to cut me out.

558
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,803
Wow, you look beautiful.

559
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,738
Thanks, Amy.

560
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:33,707
I'm super nervous.

561
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,976
- Kinda wish I was still drunk.
- Yeah.

562
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:38,745
About that...
I think we should talk.

563
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,148
Why?
Are you packing a Bellini?

564
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,883
Look, I spent the whole day
denying the fact

565
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,284
that there were signs,
but I was wrong.

566
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:46,086
- They were actually there.
- So far, duh.

567
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:48,889
The fact that you kept
cancelling your own wedding...

568
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,691
- that was the real sign.
- Whoa!

569
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,893
You took the situation,
and you flippity-flopped it.

570
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,027
I don't think it was
an accident that you got drunk,

571
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:57,197
or that you got
everyone else drunk.

572
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:59,066
What? You think I'm trying
to sabotage my own wedding?

573
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,835
I don't know.
Were you?

574
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,136
Maybe I was.

575
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,872
I don't know, something
just doesn't feel right.

576
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,340
Oh, man,
I gotta talk to Adrian.

577
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,208
I was my own sign
the whole time?

578
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:11,745
Wow, that's a real
M. Night Shyamalan twist the...

579
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,145
oh!
"Signs"!

580
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:15,949
Wait, do you think
he's behind all of this?

581
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,982
I do not.

582
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:18,819
I should go talk to Rosa.

583
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,021
Thanks, Jake.

584
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:23,090
Jake, you done good, kid.

585
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:26,426
Glad I took you along
for the ride.

586
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:28,428
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!

587
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,763
All right,
give it up for Charles.

588
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:31,431
Yeah!

589
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,066
No, give it up
for the devil sticks.

590
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,901
- They're the real heroes here.
- No, they are not.

591
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:36,269
No one thinks that.
All right, I'm not sure

592
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,505
how much time we have,
but anybody know a joke?

593
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,107
Oh, I do!

594
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:41,675
- Two Jews walk into a...
- No! Sit down!

595
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,810
No, definitely not.
Oh!

596
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:49,349
All right,
we have an announcement to make.

597
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,151
- We're not getting married.
- Aww!

598
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,619
You can shove those "awws"
up your butts.

599
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,854
Yeah, or I'll come out there,

600
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:55,121
and I'll do it for ya!

601
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:56,389
What an interesting event.

602
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,125
I just feel like
we were rushing things.

603
00:19:58,126 --> 00:19:59,860
We love each other,

604
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:01,762
but we haven't even really
spent that much time together.

605
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,130
We've never even been
on a real date,

606
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,074
so we're gonna start there.

607
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:08,869
Shut up!

608
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,470
Thank you for the presents.
We're keeping them.

609
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:11,905
- All of them.
- Yeah, if you got a problem

610
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:13,672
with it, come talk to us
in the parking lot.

611
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,876
Also, in just 14 hours
Amy put together

612
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:18,145
the most amazing
non-wedding wedding in history.

613
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:19,746
Better than
"Sleepless in Seattle."

614
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:21,715
Nope.
That is also Nora Ephron.

615
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,650
- Kill yourself.
- Don't take it personally.

616
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:25,185
Anyway, we can't let all this
go to waste.

617
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,987
Everybody, clear these chairs
out of here, and let's get

618
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:29,089
- this party started.
- No, not the chairs!

619
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,267
Don't touch the chairs,
you monsters!

620
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:36,696
- Yeah?
- Oh, I just wanted to thank you

621
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:39,032
- for all your help yesterday.
- I didn't do much.

622
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,380
It was nothing.

623
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:42,441
- Good day.

00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,812
I'm just very busy.
Get back to work.

625
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,902
Wait.
What do you have in there?

626
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,386
A balloon arch.

627
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,136
Oh, my God, Captain.

628
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,958
She is magnificent.

629
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:58,762
Vindication!
