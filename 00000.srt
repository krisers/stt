1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Oh

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,880
 Was it as good for you as it was for me

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
 Actually Niles I was faking it

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,600
 Oh

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,640
 Hi sweetie see some of the kids are going to the Hamptons for the weekend. Oh great. Will there be boys there?

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 Maybe a few

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,520
 Parents who cares they'll just get in the way anyway

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,820
 Go have a blast. We don't have enough to tell your father

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,080
 Really? Oh sure and when I'm fired and you're in the convent. We'll write each other letters and laugh about this

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,240
 But Maxwell how can you say no to working with Philippe he's an avant-garde

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,640
 Genius guilty is charged and I've put a new twist on the tragedy

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,600
 We follow Romeo and Juliet to heaven and have a happy ending

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,140
 You're really writing one of the greatest love stories of all time. We're adding a few scenes, but we're taking out others

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,840
 Which ones the ones that don't work?

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,160
 Well, I'm sorry fully but we British have a thing about mutilating Shakespeare the Queen comes and hits you with her purse

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
 But I bet you have a big name to star

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
 I'm looking for an unknown a fresh face with a unique voice

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
 I found my Juliet

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,840
 She was working in a bridal shop and flashing Queen's till her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 What was she to do? Where was she to go? She was out on her fanny

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,840
 So over the bridge and flashing to the Sheffield's door. She was there to sell makeup at the father's home. She had style

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
 She had she was there. That's how she became the nanny

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
 She was there that's how she became

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,240
 Can you imagine anything more ridiculous than me doing Shakespeare? Oh, yes people paying to see it

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,840
 I'll have you know that in high school. I played the Reverend Mother in the sounds of music

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,840
 I put a low scoop neck into my nuns have it and those hills were alive

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
 We did the sound of music I played the Baroness

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,840
 It was an all-boys school, thank God I didn't play the guitar I would have been Maria

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,840
 Who would do our laundry clean our room we don't know standing foot. Well the same person that always does miles

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,840
 Besides if I do it. It would only be for a couple of weeks

31
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,840
 Actually, I could rehearse while the kids are at school. I think not why thank you not I could use a life outside of this house

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,840
 Me too, which is why you should let me go to the Hamptons nice try forget it

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,760
 But miss fine taking care of the children is a full-time job. Oh, and I suppose it was my idea to have three

34
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,320
 What you do in your spare time is entirely your own affair

35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,480
 I'm simply trying to protect you from having an embarrassing theatrical experience. You know what that's like. Don't we sir?

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,680
 You know if some people aren't a little more supportive I might omit them from my Oscar speech

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,080
 Tony miss fine did win a Tony not an Oscar actually for an off-broadway performance miss fine would win the OB. She's not going to win anything

38
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,080
 Well, thank you for that vote of confidence. That's it. I'm playing Juliet and nothing is going to stop me

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,380
 And I'm going to the hampton down Margaret, okay

40
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,320
 Okay, Niles will you play Romeo isn't he too old

41
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,080
 Well, actually Juliet supposed to be my age so it's not like France

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
 Perfect for the role

43
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,400
 Iwarn you my acting prowess may blow you off the stage. They're still talking about my baroness. I

44
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,840
 Can't stop thinking about it, and I didn't even see it

45
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,760
 And I spent my summers in Stratford upon Avon. I spent my summers selling a fun. Oh

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,940
 She does teach the torches to burn bright it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

47
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,940
 I don't I come in here somewhere

48
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,220
 Beauty too rich for use for a ride back off Baroness

49
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,500
 And by the way, you're supposed to dust the scenery not chew it

50
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,140
 Okay, they show me how it's done. Mistress fine. Well, I will if you'll just shut it up it

51
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,800
 All for a Falconers voice to lure this tassel Gentile back again

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,360
 It's gentle not Gentile

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,920
 How should I know did I look down as tights I

54
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,720
 Still can't understand why Philippe would hire miss fine to play Juliet, please only an idiot would hire her to do anything

55
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 In the theater

56
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
 Oh

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,480
 Mr. Sheffield if you got a minute I could use your help. That's the understatement of the century

58
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,680
 Meanwhile if we put an apple in his mouth, we can have a luau

59
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,160
 Let me see oh

60
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
 I just love this play

61
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,680
 More torches here are Sarah by my fey it waxes late

62
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,560
 That's exactly what I'm talking about with Alice Faye and why she wax under in a party

63
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
 Oh

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,440
 Good luck. Sorry. Hey Romeo. It's your Juliet four three two. What took you so long?

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,880
 All right. So now we're star-crossed lovers. Let's get some physical realism into this

66
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 Put you on your balcony

67
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,640
 All right now Juliet is dreaming of her Romeo and she says I

68
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 I mean

69
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,340
 Oh speak again bright angel Oh

70
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,600
 Romeo Romeo

71
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,200
 Yes. No, maybe we could have a little more lilting just a bit more melodic. Oh sure sure sure

72
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
 Oh, Romeo

73
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,680
 Yeah, just a little too melodic I think let me show you okay

74
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
 Oh

75
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
 Romeo Romeo

76
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
 Wherefore art thou Romeo?

77
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,660
 Deny thy father and refuse thy name Wow you British guys really know how to play women

78
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,920
 We we did this play in college, oh you must have been the perfect Romeo no, I was friar Lawrence actually

79
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,680
 That's the problem going to school with Jeremy Irons

80
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,880
 Romeo that's my name and

81
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
 Take all of me

82
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,840
 I

83
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,080
 Take thee at thy word. Call me but love and I'll be new baptized

84
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,280
 You know, if I were directing this I'd go in a whole different direction

85
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,360
 I

86
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
 Parting is such sweet sorrow

87
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
 Sleep dwell in nine eyes

88
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,800
 Peace in thy breast. Oh would I was sleep and peace so sweet to rest

89
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,280
 Because this lovey-dovey stuff has just been done to death

90
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
 You know

91
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,680
 I

92
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
 Spitter

93
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,840
 I think I'm starting to get the hang of it now

94
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,160
 Of course I'm gonna need a lot of coaching

95
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
 I

96
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,600
 Am Dracul I'm going to suck out all your blood and bury you alive. You don't scare me

97
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,720
 All right fine. I'm the CC monster and I'm gonna marry dad and send you away to boarding school

98
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
 Be quiet

99
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
 I

100
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,760
 Geez dad, you don't scream about it. Look I already sent you to bed five times. What are you doing still up?

101
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,240
 Well, maybe that has something to do with a pound of chocolate. I told you not to eat

102
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,000
 You know, I think it was a gallon of cola. You told me not to drink

103
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,880
 What's your excuse? Well, he took me

104
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
 Obviously you got out

105
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,600
 Just give me one good reason why I can't go to the Hamptons

106
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
 I won't let you

107
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,400
 Margaret you're much too young to go away for the weekend by the time Juliet was my age

108
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,680
 She'd already gotten married had sex and died

109
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,120
 Well now you see what happens when you don't listen to your father

110
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,080
 Niles I'm thinking of changing the children's bedtime. Oh to when sir right after school. I

111
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,840
 Can't believe miss fine isn't back yet. I can't believe what's happened to my roast

112
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,720
 It's starting to bear a strange resemblance to Hume Cronin. I mean how much rehearsal can one person need?

113
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 Right but still

114
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,480
 Hi guys for so them I poked dinner is coming right up. Oh

115
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,440
 Niles I already ate you couldn't have called

116
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
 Ruined anyway

117
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,480
 Oh, yes, he moody well you are rather late. What are you two on the same cycle?

118
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,880
 What's the problem? Oh you couldn't handle the kids don't make me laugh

119
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,520
 What do you think the minute you leave the entire house falls apart?

120
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,800
 Now don't go in there why not when you the back stairs they're closer nothing. Yes, they are. Oh, so I measured

121
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 Oh

122
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,560
 This place looks worse when my mother ransacked my bedroom looking for my diary

123
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,720
 Well, I was looking for my glasses what you have a reading emergency

124
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,120
 So what were you doing all evening? I was at rehearsal. Oh, I called for us was over a date

125
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,020
 Well, we went out after ah, who's we?

126
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,360
 You know Romeo Mercutio tibbled the gang. Oh

127
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
 Sorry it was an accident

128
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
 So was that

129
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,920
 Boy, you leave the house for a couple hours. You come back and it's a pigsty

130
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,880
 Yeah, well, maybe if you've been here your children wouldn't have been running a muck. Oh

131
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,440
 So when they're sweet adorable angels, they're your children and when they're a mock they're mine. You are the nanny

132
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
 You want me to be now I'm getting one of my headaches

133
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,440
 You know what I think you are jealous because Philippe discovered something that was right under your nose and what would that be exactly?

134
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,840
 my star quality

135
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,560
 That's all I like discovering the atomic bomb sounds good in theory, but millions will suffer

136
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
 I

137
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,840
 Don't bother I'm sleeping on the couch

138
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,400
 If we're splitting up I get Niles you couldn't afford him

139
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,700
 It's always the butler who suffers

140
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
 I

141
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 I'm working pretend. I'm not here. That's how I get through the day. Oh

142
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 Hello Niles

143
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,640
 Would you mind telling mr. Sheffield that I'm going to rehearsal

144
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,120
 Unless of course he'd like me to sit by his feet and peel him a grape

145
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,880
 Well, that's my job, but you can waive the fan

146
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:29,520
 You can tell the nanny that I wouldn't dream of standing in the way of her aspirations no matter how ludicrous they might be

147
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,440
 Tell mr. Sheffield that I am a grown woman and can find fulfillment

148
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,300
 Any way I choose and that he is a duty hit

149
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,200
 To synopsize sir, you are a duty head

150
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
 So that's the one you choose to repeat

151
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,960
 Translators prerogative. I don't think I've ever met a more infuriating irritating woman

152
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,560
 Think hard sir, I just heard the most delicious news. Well, why don't you run make a friend and tell them all about it?

153
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,200
 I

154
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,680
 Believe needs a tax write-off. So he wants the show to flop

155
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,320
 That's why he cast nanny fine to guarantee a total disaster. I

156
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
 Knew it. I

157
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,640
 Knew she had no talent people will be walking out in the middle of her performance just like one of your dates

158
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,720
 Well, we can't tell her she'll be crushed I know

159
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:47,040
 On the other hand if if I don't tell her then she'll be publicly humiliated opening night. I know it's a win-win situation

160
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,760
 Maggie if you want to go to the Hamptons, you're gonna have to ask your father when he's watching Masterpiece Theatre

161
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,540
 Yes, just when his chin drops down to his chest, but before he starts snoring

162
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,960
 Oh sure, that's how I got my race

163
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,360
 We're doing the death scene places everybody Oh Maggie I gotta go I gotta go plunge a knife into my heart

164
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,920
 Boy, I'm sounding more like my mother every day

165
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,840
 Felipe I gotta ask you a question. I don't know what my motivation is here. Why does Julia kill herself?

166
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,340
 Because without her Romeo she has no reason to live

167
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,620
 Oh could tell this play was written by a man

168
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,940
 What she must be sleeping with him I slept with him I got two lines I got Romeo

169
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,620
 Okay Romeo drink your poison

170
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
 Here's to my love

171
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,980
 Thy drugs act quick thus with a kiss I

172
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,380
 Die now Juliet awakens

173
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
 Oh

174
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,620
 Romeo I see poison I

175
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,820
 See poison has been your timeless end Oh Cheryl

176
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
 Oh

177
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,580
 Happy dagger, this is my sheath

178
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,820
 They're rust and let me die

179
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
 Oh

180
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,780
 She's perfect this play will die faster than she does

181
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,240
 And now Romeo and Juliet ascend to heaven

182
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,340
 oh

183
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
 Wow!

184
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
 Oh!

185
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
 Oh!

186
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
 Wow!

187
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
 Oh, boy!

188
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
 Don't worry!

189
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
 I'm okay!

190
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:30,820
 Oh, but it looks like Romeo's got quite a wedgie going on up there.

191
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
 Hi!

192
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
 Hi.

193
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
 Hi.

194
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:42,820
 Gee, you know, that harness really chafes.

195
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,820
 Boy, that Mary Martin must have had to hide like a rhino.

196
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,820
 Cindy, I know you.

197
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,820
 Well, I have done six Broadway shows and several national tours.

198
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
 No, no, it was a commercial.

199
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
 You're the less than fresh girl!

200
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,820
 Oh, Mr. Sheffield!

201
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
 No, no, people, people, please!

202
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,820
 Come on, back off!

203
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
 Get away!

204
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,820
 Let the man breathe.

205
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
 Give her some air.

206
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,820
 Gee, God, she's sleeping with everybody.

207
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,820
 Watch, next year she'll have her own sitcom.

208
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,820
 Miss Fine, I owe you an apology.

209
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,820
 You owe me an apology?

210
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,820
 Oh, yeah, right.

211
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
 I was selfish and thoughtless and I'm extremely sorry.

212
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
 Oh, thank you, Mr. Sheffield.

213
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,820
 I'm sorry I called you a duty head.

214
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
 Apology accepted.

215
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
 You know, we shouldn't fight anymore.

216
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
 It's so hard on Noyles.

217
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
 Yeah, I know.

218
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,820
 Listen, I need to talk to you about this play.

219
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
 Maybe you'd better sit down.

220
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
 Oh, okay.

221
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
 I think I know what you're going to say, though.

222
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
 No, I doubt that.

223
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
 Yes, I do.

224
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,820
 You're going to say that you and the kids really need me at home

225
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,820
 and the mansion is a mess and I don't belong in this play

226
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,820
 and, well, you'd be absolutely right.

227
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
 I would?

228
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
 Yeah, isn't that what you were going to say?

229
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,820
 Oh, yes, yes, that was exactly what...

230
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
 You read my mind.

231
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,820
 I thought Glee of Wayans runs in my family.

232
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,820
 I got an ampola that predicted Hurricane Andrew.

233
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
 For the first time in history,

234
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,820
 there wasn't a single Jew on Miami Beach.

235
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,820
 Come on, I'm going to take you home.

236
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,820
 I just thought that Philip isn't too disappointed.

237
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,820
 I mean, he really was counting on me.

238
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,820
 Well, Miss Fine, a talent like yours doesn't come along every day.

239
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,820
 True, but you know, between you, me and the Pillars,

240
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,820
 that Philip is not the greatest director in the world.

241
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,820
 And if I'm going to make my big Broadway debut,

242
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,820
 I should do it right in one of your plays.

243
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
 Now back to Masterpiece Theatre, Part 26,

244
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,820
 The Lords of Thysbury.

245
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,820
 Psst, Maggie, make your move.

246
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
 Hi, Dad.

247
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
 Oh.

248
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,820
 Are you asleep?

249
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
 Mmm, yeah.

250
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
 Are you going to let me go to the Hamptons?

251
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
 Mmm, sure, honey.

252
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
 When Miss Fine gets her next raise.

253
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,820
 Ever since Alastair Cook left, he doesn't sleep as well.

254
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
 Yeah.

255
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
 Lunch!

256
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,820
 Oh, good.

257
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
 Hello?

258
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,820
 People?

259
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
 Oh, people?

260
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,820
 Where fought on, everyone?

261
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
 Hello?

262
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,820
 Hi.
