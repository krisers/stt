The story revolves around a false police officer named Detective Milgram, who manipulates a fast-food restaurant manager, Dwight Lomax, into sexually abusing a teenage employee, Trini Martinez, through a series of phone calls. The real Detective Milgram turns out to be a fictional character created by a man named Merritt Rook, who is an engineer with a history of challenging authority and a grudge against conformity. Rook is eventually caught and stands trial, where he defends himself and becomes a sort of folk hero. However, he is found not guilty.
